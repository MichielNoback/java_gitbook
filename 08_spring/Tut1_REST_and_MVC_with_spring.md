# REST and MVC with Spring

## Create a new project
1. Open IntelliJ
2. Choose New Projectâ€¦
    a. Spring Initializr &rarr; Next  
    b. Give Group & Artifact &rarr; Next  
    c. Choose Gradle / Java / Jar &rarr; Next  
    d. Choose Dependencies:   
        i. Web &rarr; Spring Web  
        ii. Template Engines &rarr; ThymeleafSQL &rarr; JDBC API / Spring Data JPA / JDBC / MySQL Driver [Can be added later]  
	e. Choose location &rarr; Next & Finish  

	The build.gradle file will have these dependencies:

	```groovy
	dependencies {
		implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf'
		implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
		testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
	}
	```

3. Go to root folder `/main/java/<your/package>/` and open `<YourProject>Application.java`.  Run Application by clicking on the green triangle in the margin.

	```java
	@SpringBootApplication
	public class SpringDemoProjectApplication {

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			SpringApplication.run(SpringDemoProjectApplication.class, args);
		}
	}
	```

4. Go to your browser (or Postman!) and open [localhost/8080](localhost/8080). This will generate "Whitelabel Error Page" in the browser, or in Postman this:

	```json
	{
		"timestamp": "2021-01-12T09:54:58.110+00:00",
		"status": 404,
		"error": "Not Found",
		"message": "",
		"path": "/"
	}
	```

OK, the app works, but there nothing (no data or web page) is being served by the application at this url so you get an `404/Not Found`. Let's fix that

## Create a REST response  

Right click on base package &rarr; New &rarr; Package &rarr; name = `webcontrol`
Right click on this package &rarr; New &rarr; Java Class &rarr; name = `HelloRest`

In the  editor, modify the class so it looks like this

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/hello")
public class HelloRest {

	@GetMapping(value = "/rest1")
	public String getHello() {
		return "Hello Spring Boot!";
	}
}
```
The corresponding import statements will appear as well. There are several core _Spring annotations_ here that warrant some explanation.

The annotation `@RestController` tells the Spring container that this class will service REST (REpresentational State Transfer) endpoints. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for details.

`@RequestMapping` publishes this class to serve all urls that start with `/hello` relative to the _context path_ of this application. `@GetMapping` serves the same purpose, but only for GET requests. And in this case, applies only to the method it annotates. Therefore, the url `<app_root>/hello/rest1` will map to this method. Since the entire class is annotated as being a REST controller, all return values of its controller methods will be converted into JSON literals (using the Jackson library).

Now reload the app by pressing this button in the lower panel:

![](pictures/reload.png)

Go to Postman and hit the endpoint [http://localhost:8080/hello/rest1](http://localhost:8080/hello/rest1).
You should get this:

>Hello Spring Boot!

### Serve Json literals

Create a new package (model) with a new class, `Bird`, and generate a constructor, `toString()` and getters for all fields.

```java
package nl.bioinf.model;

public class Bird{
private String name;
private String status;

public Bird (String name, String status) {
	this.name = name;
	this.status = status;
}
//boilerplate code omitted
```

Create a new method within class `HelloRest`.

```java
@GetMapping(value = "/rest2")
public Bird getBird() {
	return new Bird("Long-legged buzzard", "extremely rare");
}
```

Hit the endpoint [http://localhost:8080/hello/rest2](http://localhost:8080/hello/rest2). As you can see, a JSON literal is returned representing a Java Bird instance. That is because your annotated with `@RestController`. This gives Java to json conversion out of the box.

### Path Variables

Create a new method within `HelloRest`

```java
@GetMapping(value="/echo/{msg}")
public String doEcho(@PathVariable String msg) {
	return "You said" + msg + "...I say goodbye.";
}
```

Note that the three occurrences of "msg" should be typed exactly the same! Hit the endpoint [http://localhost:8080/hello/echo/I%20Rule%20Rest](http://localhost:8080/hello/echo/I%20Rule%20Rest). You will get this:  
`You said I Rule Rest...I say goodbye.`

There is a new annotation here: `@PathVariable`. It is used on a method parameter. Together with the `value="/echo/{msg}"` attribute of `@GetMapping`, it tells the container that there is a request variable embedded in the url and it should be extracted into `String msg`.

### Request Parameters

Create a new method within `HelloRest`

```java
@GetMapping(value="/echo_name")
public String doEchoName(@RequestParam(value = "name") String name) {
	return "You said" + name + "...I say goodbye.";
}
```

And go to url [http://localhost:8080/hello/echo_name?name=<your_name>](http://localhost:8080/hello/echo_name?name=<your_name>)

The annotation `@RequestParam(value = "name")` tells the system that the GET request should contain a request parameter called `name` and it should be inserted into the value of `String name`. You can specify whether it is a required parameter, and whether it should have a default value.:

```java
    @GetMapping(value = "/echo_name")
    public String doEchoName(@RequestParam(
			value = "name", 
			required = false, 
			defaultValue = "JohnDoe") String name) {
        return "You said " + name + "...I say goodbye.";
    }
```

### An html view

So far you have seen three basic ways of serving data using a REST endpoint. Now we'll switch to serving an html view using Thymeleaf.
Create a new class within package `webcontrol` called `HelloMvc`, with this content

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping(value="greeting")
public class HelloMvc {

	@GetMapping(value="hello")
	public String getGreeting(Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("greeting", "Hello to MVC");
		return "greeting";
	}
}
```

Under folder `/src/main/resources/templates`, right-click and select New &rarr; Thymeleaf. This will generate a standard html page. Replace 

```html
	<h1 th:tekst="#{page.title}">Offline title</h1> 
```

with 

```html
<h1 th:text="${greeting}">_greeting_</h1>
```

Reload the app and hit the endpoint [http://localhost:8080/greeting/hello](http://localhost:8080/greeting/hello). Postman will show this:

```html
	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<head>
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
		<title>Phrase of the day</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello to MVC</h1>
	</body>
	</html>
```

Whereas the browser will show 

![hello MVC](pictures/hello_mvc.png)

This concludes a first acquaintance with several aspects of the Spring (Boot) framework. You have seen the creation and consuming of both REST and MVC-type endpoints.
