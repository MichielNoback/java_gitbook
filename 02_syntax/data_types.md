# Data Types

As stated before, Java is a **_strongly typed_** language. That means every variable, method parameter and method return type needs to have a declared type. These types can be **_primitives_** or **_reference types_**. This post deals with both, and with the "behavioral" differences between them.

## Primitives

In essence, every programming language knows about the same data types: integers, floats, booleans, Strings. Java is no different. However, there are tow major distinctions. First, you need to declare the type of every variable, and conversion between them usually needs to be done explicitly. Also, for memory efficiency reasons, there are "subtypes" of integers and floats. Floating-point numbers for instance (numbers with a decimal part), can be represented by the `float` type ("floating point number) or the `double` ("double-precision floating point number") which takes twice as much of memory. You have to realise Java was first launched in the 1990s, when memory was a scarce and valuable asset in a computer...
