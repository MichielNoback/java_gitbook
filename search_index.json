This chapter deals with using IntelliJ Idea to create \nJava applications.\nDependency management\nAs you probably already know by now, code you write is \ndependent on other code. This can be code native to the platform (such as the \ninteger \"class\" in R, or the str class in Python), but it can also be code \nthat is not distributed with the standard platform (such as ggplot2 in R).\nThese \"non-core\" code dependencies need to be managed, especially with a compiled \nlanguage such as Java. Several tools exist for dependency management in Java. In\n this course we'll use Gradle. It does much more than dependency management, but for \n now this is the relevant aspect.\nA first project\nStart IntelliJ and select \"+ Create New Project\" from the start screen. \n\nIn the New Project wizard, select Gradle on the left menu and then a project SDK (Standard Development Kit) - the examples \nshows Java 10. Only check Java in the Libraries section.\n\nClick \"Next\". In the next window, give your project a GroupID, an ArtifactID and a Version. \n\nThe group ID should be a unique identifier; in Java this is usually the web domain of you or your employer, reversed and with a project name appended (note the underscores). The artifact ID is the name of your project. The version speaks for itself.\nClick \"Next\".\nThe last window lets you specify some Gradle-specific stuff. Fill out as shown below.\n\nClick \"Next\". \n\nClick \"Finish\". A fresh Gradle-managed Java project will be created with a layout as shown below.\n\nSeveral folders and files have been created. At the root of the project there is a build.gradle file. It contains the configuration of your project. One dependency has been added: JUnit 4 which is a testing framework. Since this is an older version, we'll immediately change this into JUnit5. Replace as shown below:\ndependencies {\n    //don't use JUnit 4\n    //testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'\n    //JUnit 5 is better\n    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.1.0'\n    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.1.0'\n}\n\nMaybe IntelliJ suggests something about auto-import; accept this.\nFinally, let's create some code. Right-click on the src/main/java folder and select \"New\" -> \"Package\" and give it the same name as your group ID (it is also in build.gradle).\n\nSelect the new package, right-click it and select \"New\" -> \"Java Class\". Name it HelloWorld (do not give any file extension!) and click \"OK\".\n\n\nThe class file will open in an editor. Here is a taste of the IntelliJ magic. Within the class, put the caret below the line public class HelloWorld. Next, type \"psvm\" and press tab.\n\n\nA brand new main() method is created. Here is another extremely useful shortcut, assuming the caret is within main(). Type \"sout\" followed by the tab. \n\nThe statement System.out.println(); appears. Within this print call, type \"Hello, World\". Your class should look like this, except that your package will be named differently:\npackage nl.bioinf.nomi.my_first_project;\n\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, World\");\n    }\n}\n\nClick the green triangle within the editor border and select \"run 'HelloWorld.main()' Note the shortcut for running main: ^ + shift + R.\n\nIn the console output on the lower pane, you will see this output, including the \"Hello, World\" message:\n\n20:38:51: Executing task 'HelloWorld.main()'...\n\n> Task :compileJava\n> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE\n> Task :classes\n\n> Task :HelloWorld.main()\nHello, World\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 0s\n2 actionable tasks: 2 executed\n20:38:52: Task execution finished 'HelloWorld.main()'.\n\n\nThe \"Tasks\" are gradle stuff. It says, amongst others, that the source is compiled (Java is a compiled language!) and main() is run. You may notice that a new folder has appeared at the root of your project: build. Have a look at what's inside.\nThat's it. This is how you create a Gradle-managed Java project, put a package in it, a first class at the correct location and within that, a main() method.\nThese are the keyboard shortcuts you should remember:\n\npsvm - create main()\nsout - create print statement\n^ + shift + R - run main()\n\nNext up: some really basic Java stuff to get a feel for the language.\n"},"01_getting_started/essentials.html":{"url":"01_getting_started/essentials.html","title":"The essentials","keywords":"","body":"The essence of Java\nThis part deals with the essentials of the Java programming language. Java is a very popular platform for several reasons: it is the basis of Android, it is embedded in many domestic appliances, and it has a nice clear object-oriented design.\nCross-platform\nJava is cross-platform in the sense that once it is compiled into an executable, it can be run on any operating system that has a Java Runtime installed. This Java installation instantiates a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and passes your compiled code to it, including instructions on which main() method to start on.\nMultithreaded\nCreating multithreaded applications and algorithm is extremely easy because multicore support is build into the language from version 1, and greatly enhanced with the introduction of the Stream API in Java 8.\nObject-Oriented\nIn Java, you cannot run a script. Instead, you write a program where everything you create resides in classes. Classes reside in their own source file. One of these classes must contain a main() method. You let the JVM know which class has the main method you want executed.\nBesides the raw -primitive- data types such as integer (int) and double, all types are represented by classes, which define the blueprint to construct objects. So objects are the representations (instances) of a single class - more formally called a type. Java provides many types, and you will routinely define your own types when programming.\nA class is a type blueprint that is used to instantiate objects\nThese objects, the number of which can range from one to many millions within a running application, are the fabric of the program. They hold data (called instance variables) and methods that define their behavior and functionality. \nStrongly typed and scoped\nThis aspect can at first be a bit daunting when coming from languages such as Python or R. Every variable you use must have a declared type. Moreover, every member (instance variable or method) has keywords defining its scope/visibility. Here is an example class that shows these aspects. Read the comments (between /** and */) to see what everything means. You do not have to remember or understand all these keywords yet, only get an idea of their role within the code.\npackage snippets;\n\n/**\n * Class Snp models a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in its simplest form.\n * The class is public, so any class within the project may instantiate it.\n */\npublic class Snp {\n    /**\n     * These are the INSTANCE VARIABLES that model the SNPs data\n     * They are PRIVATE, so they can not be accessed from outside this class.\n     * The types are long (integer) and character (single letter)\n     */\n    private long position;\n    private char referenceNucleotide;\n    private char alternativeNucleotide;\n\n    /**\n     * This is the CONSTRUCTOR method that forces client code to provide the three essential\n     * properties of a Snp that every INSTANCE should have defined before being INSTANTIATED.\n     * It is public so accessible to all. Properties are passed as constructor arguments and\n     * stored as INSTANCE VARIABLES.\n     * @param position a long integer\n     * @param reference a single character: A, C, G or T\n     * @param alternative a single character: A, C, G or T\n     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the given position is negative\n     */\n    public Snp(long position, char reference, char alternative) {\n        if (position \nCompiled\nJava is a compiled language, which means you have to compile the source into byte code before it can be run. Fortunately, you have to compile it only once, for the JVM and not multiple times, for every OS you want to support.\nWhenever you run an application within IntelliJ, it is first compiled: all source files (.java files) are compiled into byte code files that have a .class extension. You can find these in the build folder. To create a distributable application, you need to build it into a \"Jar\" - with .jar extension. You run these on the command line using the \ncommand java -jar . The Gradle toolbox has all kinds of Tasks to automate this for you. \nRelated to this: Run-time syntax errors do not occur - they are stopped by the compiler. The compiler will not compile erroneous code.\n"},"01_getting_started/first_look_at_objects.html":{"url":"01_getting_started/first_look_at_objects.html","title":"Demo case: A first look at objects","keywords":"","body":"A first look at objects: growing cells\nThe entities\nSuppose you want to build a cell growth simulation application. After careful analysis of\nthe domain, I decided that this involves three entities I want to model: a simulator that\ncontrols the simulation process, a test tube that will hold the cells that are growing, and \ncells.\nThe relationships\nThe next step in a modeling process is to determine the relationships between the different \nentities. In this case, this is quite simple. The simulator will receive configuration arguments \n(e.g. how many cells to grow) from the command-line, start the simulation process and \ninstantiate a test tube. The test tube will be responsible for instantiating the (initial) cell\npopulation. Finally, there will be cells growing \"within\" the test tube.\nThe code\nThree separate source files are created (within a single package), each holding one class - a \nblueprint for the entities to be instantiated:\n\nCellGrowthSimulator.java\nTestTube.java\nCell.java\n\nCell.java\nWe'll start with the simplest one: Cell. It has an instance variable called \"size\" which has a default \nvalue of 5 when Cell objects are instantiated. Every call of the grow() method makes it increase its size by one.\npackage snippets.testtube;\n\nclass Cell {\n    /**\n     * Instance variable \"size\"; 5 micrometer is the default diameter when Cell objects are instantiated\n     */\n    int diameter = 5;\n    /**\n     * Lets this cell grow in a single increment\n     */\n    void grow() {\n        //grow by 1 micrometer\n        this.diameter += 1;\n        System.out.println(\"I am a Cell. My size is \" + this.diameter);\n    }\n}\n\nTo test the logic and correctness of this class, we will have to wait until other components are \ndeveloped, such as TestTube and CellGrowthSimulator, unless you use (J)Unit testing. \nThe keyword this\nTo indicate you want to access properties or methods of the current active object, you use this together with the dot operator.\nIt is not required (the compiler will fill it in) to use this, but it makes for much more readable code if you consistently use it when referring to object members (methods and variables).\nJUnit testing\nJUnit is a unit test platform for Java. Its main purpose is to have a suite of test code guaranteeing \nthe correctness of your production code. To create JUnit test code, you need to have the \nJUnit libraries defined as dependencies on your class path. \nSee the post \"A first IntelliJ project\" for instructions how to \nthat for JUnit5.\nNext, you need to create a test class. Place the cursor on the class name and press alt+enter. Select \"Create Test\".\n \nSelect the method(s) you want to create test(s) for.\n\nThe test class opens in the editor and looks something like this:\npackage snippets.testtube;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\n\nclass CellTest {\n\n    @Test\n    void grow() {\n    }\n}\n\nLet's put some testing code in it to see whether our program logic works as intended:\n    @Test\n    void grow() {\n        Cell cell = new Cell();\n        //the initial diameter is supposed to be 5\n        assertTrue(cell.diameter == 5);\n        cell.grow();\n        //the diameter should have increased by one\n        assertTrue(cell.diameter == 6);\n    }\n\nWhen you click on the little green triangle in the editor margin, the test will be executed and you get output like this:\n\nThe green checks indicate the test assertions passed. Knowing the Cell class is OK, let's proceed to class TestTube.\nTestTube.java\nTestTube is slightly more complex. It defines a constructor that makes it mandatory to\nprovide an initial number of cells. Also, you see the use of the new keyword for instantiating objects.\npackage snippets.testtube;\n\nclass TestTube {\n    Cell[] cells;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructs with an initial cell count.\n     * An exception is thrown when the initial cell count is below 1 or above 10e4.\n     *\n     * @param initialCellCount the initial cell count\n     * @throws IllegalArgumentException ex\n     */\n    TestTube(int initialCellCount) {\n        if (initialCellCount == 0 || initialCellCount > 10e4) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"initial cell count should be above 1 and below 10e4: \" + initialCellCount);\n        }\n        //initialize the array with new Cells\n        cells = new Cell[initialCellCount];\n        for (int i = 0; i \nNote the for-loop in the constructor of this class:\nfor (int i = 0; i \nThe for-loop itself will be dealt with in the post \"Flow control structures\" This is the first place we see the new keyword. Whenever you see the new keyword, it means a new object is instantiated. See the section below for more detail on object construction. \nHere is a simple JUnit test to verify the construction of the TestTube:\nclass TestTubeTest {\n    @Test\n    void growCells() {\n        TestTube testTube = new TestTube(10);\n        assertTrue(testTube.cells.length == 10);\n    }\n}\n\nCellGrowthSimulator.java\nThe last class of the system. Here is the first version:\npackage snippets.testtube;\n/**\n * \"Controller\" class\n */\nclass CellGrowthSimulator {\n    /**\n     * @param args cl-args should be length one, containing initial cell number.\n     */\n    static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length != 1) {\n            System.err.println(\"You must provide an initial cell count. Aborting.\");\n        }\n\n        int initialCellNumber = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);\n        startSimulation(initialCellNumber);\n    }\n\n    static void startSimulation(int initialCellNumber) {\n        TestTube testTube = new TestTube(initialCellNumber);\n        //do one iteration of growing\n        testTube.growCells();\n    }\n}\n\nNote that directly processing command-line arguments is discouraged in general; you should implement\nand support a standards-adhering command-line syntax (e.g. java -jar GrowthSimulator --initial_count 5).\nSo the final model now has this chain of relationships:\nCellGrowthSimulator has a TestTube and TestTube has one or more Cells.\nObject construction (first iteration)\nYou have seen the new keyword used several times now. But what does happen, exactly, when you type\nCell cell = new Cell();\n\nThe new keyword combined with the class name followed by parentheses, calls the constructor method of a class that instantiates and returns the reference to an object of that class. The parentheses () enclose the argument list for the constructor method, which is empty in this case.  \nThe three steps of object construction are declaration, creation and assignment:\n\nCell cell declares a variable of type Cell.\nnew Cell instantiates an object of type Cell, stores this in memory (called the heap in Java) and returns a reference to this stored object.\n= assigns the returned reference to the declared variable.\n\nSo…where is this constructor method in class Cell and what does it do? It is created automagically by the \nJava compiler, if you don't specify it yourself. More on constructors in a later post.\nInheritance\nInheritance is one of the key features of object-oriented programming.\nSince subclasses inherit all properties and methods of their superclass, this is a very \npowerful mechanism to introduce new or adjusted behavior in a software \nsystem. The CancerCell class below extends Cell and thus declares itself\nto be a subclass of Cell. It not only extends itself with new functionality (move()), but also modifies the behavior of the grow() method by changing the growthIncrement property of its supertype part.\nclass Cell {\n    int diameter = 5;\n    int growthIncrement = 1;\n\n    /**\n     * Lets this cell grow in a single increment\n     */\n    void grow() {\n        //grow by 1 micrometer\n        this.diameter += growthIncrement;\n        System.out.println(\"I am a Cell. My size is \" + this.diameter);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CancerCell extends Cell {\n    CancerCell() {\n        growthIncrement = 3;\n    }\n\n    void move() {\n        System.out.println(\"Moving through the body\");\n    }\n}\n\n//usage\nCell cell = new Cell();\ncell.grow();\ncell.grow();\nSystem.out.println(\"-----------\");\nCancerCell cCell = new CancerCell();\ncCell.grow();\ncCell.grow();\ncCell.move();\n\noutput:\n\nI am a Cell. My size is 6\nI am a Cell. My size is 7\n-----------\nI am a Cell. My size is 8\nI am a Cell. My size is 11\nMoving through the body\n\n"},"02_syntax/basic_program_design.html":{"url":"02_syntax/basic_program_design.html","title":"Basic program design","keywords":"","body":"Basic program structure and flow\nBasic program structure and flow. Advanced flow (switch etc) will be described later.\nBasic program structure\nAs stated before, a Java program must have a main() method as starting point. \nThis main() method needs to reside in a class, because all Java code needs to live inside a class.\n/**\n * The package declaration; it defines the namespace of this class\n * */\npackage snippets;\n\npublic class MostBasicApp {\n    /**\n     * This is a STATIC method, which means it is a class-level method and needs no object/instance to\n     * be called.\n     * The return type is \"void\": it does not return anything.\n     * @param args the command-line arguments are passed here as string array\n     */\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Basic App has started\");\n        System.out.println(\"...and ended\");\n    }\n}\n\nThis is a very uninteresting app of course, since it doesn't do anything. Let's extend it with a bit \nof functionality. We'll pass the program 2 arguments: one for age and one for user name. If no \narguments are provided, we'll print some usage information.\nTo pass command-line arguments within IntelliJ, you need to create or edit a run configuration.\nIf you have run the main before (by clicking on the green triangle - see post intelliJ), you \nclick on the toolbar run configurations box and select \"Edit configurations\"- see screenshot.\n\nThe only thing yu need to do now is enter two \"Program arguments\". Here, I filled out \"Henk\" and \"49\", with a space between them.\n\nAn array (which is kind of a list) of String elements called args will be passed to main() as String[] args. This array will hold the command line arguments when next running the program, as demonstrated below.\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    for (String arg : args) {\n        System.out.println(\"arg = \" + arg);\n    }\n}\n\nThis will output \n\narg = Henk\narg = 49\n\n\nHere you hae seen the first program flow construct in action: the foreach loop. It is equivalent to for-loops in any programming language: it iterates a collection of some sort. Here the collection is an array. Note it does not have a counter; there is a different variant of the for loop for that.\nLet's introduce one other flow construct: decisions with if/else.\nSuppose you want to give your user some uplifting message, depending on their age. First the age argument needs to be converted from String to int:\n/**\n  * Use indexing to access array elements\n  */\nString name = args[0];\n/**\n  * Parse String into int\n  */\nint age = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);\nSystem.out.println(\"Hi \" + name + \", your age is \" + age);\n\nNext, the choice of message needs to be made.\nif(age \nThe classic elements of the if/else decision block.\nFinally, let's bring a dedicated object into play: the message maker. The class looks like this:\npackage snippets;\n\npublic class MessageMaker {\n    private final String name;\n    private final int age;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor makes it mandatory to instantiate with name and age arguments.\n     * @param name\n     * @param age\n     */\n    public MessageMaker(String name, int age) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public void printMessage() {\n        System.out.println(\"Hi \" + name + \", your age is \" + age);\n\n        if(age \nAnd this is how you instantiate and use an object of such a class.\npublic class MostBasicApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String name = args[0];\n        int age = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);\n\n        /*A first object is instantiated and a method is called on it.*/\n        MessageMaker messageMaker = new MessageMaker(name, age);\n        messageMaker.printMessage();\n    }\n}\n\nSo, here we have a two-class application. Both source files are in the same package (namespace). The first is the so-called \"main class\" which is the entry point of the application: MostBasicApp in source file MostBasicApp.java. The main method receives the command-line arguments and parses one of them into an integer. Next, it instantiates a MessageMaker object and calls its printMessage() method.\nSummary\nYou have seen the basic structure of a Java program. It needs at least one source file with one class. There needs to be a main() method of this signature to be executable as program:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n  //startup code\n}\n\nTwo flow control structures were shown: the for-each loop and if/else decisions:\n//foreach\nfor(item : collection) {}\n//if/else\nif(conditionIsTrue) {}\nelse if(alternativeConditionIsTrue){}\nelse {/*default logic*/}\n\nThat's it. Next up: Data Types.\n"},"02_syntax/data_types.html":{"url":"02_syntax/data_types.html","title":"Data types","keywords":"","body":"Data Types\nData forms the state of an object. They define the properties that define how it will behave through methods.\nAs stated before, Java is a strongly typed language. That means every variable, method parameter and method return type needs to have a declared type. These types can be primitives or reference types. This post deals with both, and with the \"behavioral\" differences between them.\nPrimitives\nIn essence, every programming language knows about the same data types: integers, floats, booleans, Strings. Java is no different. However, there are a few major distinctions. First, you need to declare the type of every variable. Also, conversion between them usually needs to be done explicitly. Finally, for memory efficiency reasons, there are \"subtypes\" of integers and floats. Floating-point numbers for instance (numbers with a decimal part), can be represented by the float type (\"floating point number) or the double (\"double-precision floating point number\") which takes twice as much of memory. You have to realise Java was first launched in the 1990s, when memory was a scarce and valuable asset in a computer...\nHere are all the primitive types:\n\nThe three steps of primitive type creation are these.\n\nFirst, a variable of a certain type is declared. A memory slot of the appropriate size is reserved. Then the bit-pattern representing the declared value is created and put into the memory slot. Finally the variable is \"coupled\" to the memory slot.\nHere is some demo code where some of these types are used.\nclass JavaTypesDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        /* INTEGER counts the number of kills */\n        int killCount = 42;\n\n        /*BOOLEAN for yes/no variables; indicates alive status*/\n        boolean alive = false;\n\n        /*DOUBLE for floating point values; indicates the average number of kills per life cycle*/\n        double killAverage = 10.55;\n\n        /*CHARACTER for single letter values;\n        stores mode of the game 'N'=No mercy 'S'= Sissy*/\n        char playmode = 'N';\n\n        /*STRING for text values; the name of the player*/\n        String player = \"ZZZZZombie\";\n\n        System.out.println(\"player =       \" + player);\n        System.out.println(\"alive =        \" + alive);\n        System.out.println(\"play mode =    \" + playmode);\n        System.out.println(\"kill count =   \" + killCount);\n        System.out.println(\"kill average = \" + killAverage);\n    }\n}\n\nThis will output\nplayer =       ZZZZZombie\nalive =        false\nplay mode =    N\nkill count =   42\nkill average = 10.55\nIn the above example, all variables were declared and initialized in one statement, but it is allowed \nto split this up. The only thing that is illegal (not compilable) is to leave a declared variable uninitialized and \naccess it:\n//LEGAL\nint killCount;\nkillCount = 0;\n\n//ILLEGAL; not initialized\nint livesLived; //no compile error here\nSystem.out.println(\"livesLived = \" + livesLived); //but here!\n\nWhen combining primitives in mathematical operations, they usually behave as expected. However, when you start combining them in a \"mixed\" environment, it becomes a bit tricky. The general rule is it is always safe to \"up\" the precision or keep it equal, but dangerous to \"lower\" the precision. For that reason, lowering the precision needs to be done explicitly, through a (type) cast. Here are a few examples using primitives.\nint x = 10;\nint y = 20;\nint squareSurface = x * y; //200\n\nNo problem here. Two ints combine to a new int. Precision stays the same. In the next example, the Math class is \nused in two ways. Math.PI is a constant and Math.pow() is a function. Both are used to calculate the surface area of a circle:  \ndouble circleSurface = Math.PI * Math.pow((0.5 * x), 2); //78.53981633974483\n\nNote that an int, x is used in a double context (0.5 * x) without any problem. The int is \"upped\" in precision to a double. Whenever an int is used in conjunction with a double, it is automatically cast into the higher-precision type (more on casting later). But in the next snippet, \ndouble division = x / y;\nSystem.out.println(\"division = \" + division);\n\nthe output is, slightly unexpected\ndivision = 0.0\nCan you explain?\nTwo ints were divided (x / y or 10 / 20), resulting in an int. Since ints do not have a decimal part,\nthis is 0. Casting a zero to a double subsequently resulted in 0.0.\nHow to circumvent this problem? You need to convert one of them in an early stage into a double. Although both would work,\nit is more logical to cast the numerator (x) to a double.\ndouble division = (double)x / y;\nSystem.out.println(\"division = \" + division);\n//outputs division = 0.5\n\nBecause x was cast to a double, y found itself in an operation involving a double. It was therefore automatically cast into a double as well, resulting in a double division.\nHere is an example where you are forced by the compiler to cast from double to int.\ndouble ratio = 1.234;\nint intRatio = ratio; //DOES NOT COMPILE!\nint intRatio = (int)ratio; //LEGAL\n\nSince conversion from double to int has the risk of loss of information (precision), you are forced by the compiler to be explicit about it.\nHere are some more esoteric behaviors of primitives, ad cases that are (unexpectedly) illegal:\nchar nucleotide = 'A';\n//allowed, because a char is an 16-bit int under water\nSystem.out.println(nucleotide * 10); //650\nSystem.out.println((char)(nucleotide + 5)); //F\n\nboolean isAlive = true;\n//not allowed; although in some languages this works just fine\n//System.out.println(\"isAlive * 10 = \" + isAlive * 10);\n\nString name = \"Hank\";\n//surprisingly, this is allowed; the int is automatically converted (not cast!) into a String\nSystem.out.println(name + 10); //Hank10\n\n//not allowed; the * operator does not support these two types as operands\n//System.out.println(\"name * 10 = \" + name * 10);\n\nReference types\nIn Java, reference types are everywhere; they point to the object instances. Strings, arrays, and every\nJava class -also the ones you create- represent reference types.\nWith primitive-typed variables, the value of the variable is simply the value, in bits, but with reference variables, \nthe value of the variable is bits representing a way to get to a specific object (like a remote control)\n\nCreating a reference type variable\n\nType String\nType String needs some special attention. It is actually NOT a primitive type, although always dealt with alongside them.\nYou could have guessed from the name, which starts with a capital. It is a full-fledged Java class that can be instantiated and that has many nice methods. It is however immutable as in most languages, and has a shortcuts that most other classes do not have: you can create them from a literal.\nHere is some example usage of class String.\nString dnaOne = \"AGAGGTCTAGCTGA\";\nString dnaTwo = \"GGTCTAGC\";\nString dnaThree = \"GGtctAGc\";\nString dnaFour = dnaThree.toUpperCase();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaOne - character at position 6: \" + dnaOne.charAt(5)); //T\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaOne contains dnaTwo: \" + dnaOne.contains(dnaTwo)); //true\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaTwo equals dnaThree ignoring case: \" + dnaTwo.equalsIgnoreCase(dnaThree)); //true\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaOne starts with \\\"AGAGGT\\\": \" + dnaOne.startsWith(\"AGAGGT\")); //true\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaFour.toCharArray(): \" + dnaFour.toCharArray()); \n//[C@6f3b5d16 but this changes: this is the reference value (the remote control endpoint)\n\nTesting equality (of Strings)\nA very common mistake with beginning (and advanced) Java programmers is the way String comparison is carried out.\nTo test sameness, use ==. This returns true if the variables are the same primitives or point to the same object on the heap.To test logical equality, use the .equals() method. Strings may be the same in content, but return false when tested for sameness: two distinct string objects on the heap can have the same content.\nString dnaOne = \"AGAGGTCTAGCTGA\";\nString dnaFive = new String(\"AGAGGTCTAGCTGA\");\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaOne equals dnaFive: \" + dnaOne.equals(dnaFive));\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaOne == dnaFive: \" + (dnaOne == dnaFive));\n\noutputs:\n\ndnaOne equals dnaFive: true\ndnaOne == dnaFive: false\n\n\nand to make it more confusing:\nString dnaOne = \"AGAGGTCTAGCTGA\";\nString dnaSix = \"AGAGGTCTAGCTGA\";\nSystem.out.println(\"dnaOne == dnaSix: \" + (dnaOne == dnaSix));\n\noutputs:\n\ndnaOne == dnaSix: true\n\n\nAnd this has to do with String literal caching by the JVM.\nA special case: null\nThere s a special value for reference type variables: the null value. It can be assigned to all Java \nreference type variables. This value is used when you want to declare a variable, but don't know a useful default or starting value for it. However, there is great danger lurking when using null values. They are not backed by an object, so when you try to access values on them, or call methods, you get a big fat NullPointerException thrown in your face.\nstatic void nullValueDemo() {\n    String nullString = null;\n    //prints just fine!\n    System.out.println(\"nullString = \" + nullString);\n    //NullPointerException!\n    nullString.charAt(0);\n}\n\noutputs\n\nnullString = null\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at snippets.JavaTypesDemo.nullValueDemo(JavaTypesDemo.java:145)\n    at snippets.JavaTypesDemoTest.nullValueDemoTest(JavaTypesDemoTest.java:36)\n    (stack trace continues)\n\n\nWhat is the difference?\nTo be passed around as primitive\nJava is pass-by-copy, so to pass a primitive means to pass a copy of it. Whatever happens with the copy has no impact on the original:\nstatic void primitivePassingDemo() {\n    int x = 42;\n    System.out.println(\"x = \" + x);\n    changePrimitiveVariable(x);\n    System.out.println(\"x = \" + x);\n}\n\nstatic void changePrimitiveVariable(int number) {\n    System.out.println(\"number = \" + number);\n    number = 55;\n    System.out.println(\"number = \" + number);\n}\n\noutputs this:\n\nx = 42\nnumber = 42\nnumber = 55\nx = 42\n\n\nTo be passed around as reference type\nJava is pass-by-copy, so to pass a reference type means to pass a copy of the reference. Now you have two references pointing to the same object on the heap.\nstatic void referencePassingDemo() {\n    Cell cell = new Cell();\n    System.out.println(\"cell.diameter = \" + cell.diameter);\n    changeReferenceVariable(cell);\n    System.out.println(\"cell.diameter = \" + cell.diameter);\n}\n\nstatic void changeReferenceVariable(Cell theCell) {\n    System.out.println(\"theCell.diameter = \" + theCell.diameter);\n    theCell.diameter = 12;\n    System.out.println(\"theCell.diameter = \" + theCell.diameter);\n}\n\noutputs this:\n\ncell.diameter = 5\ntheCell.diameter = 5\ntheCell.diameter = 12\ncell.diameter = 12\n\n\nSo, switching back to String, which is a reference type. Can you explain this behavior?\nstatic void stringPassingDemo() {\n    String hello = \"Hello World\";\n    System.out.println(\"hello = \" + hello);\n    changeStringVariable(hello);\n    System.out.println(\"hello = \" + hello);\n}\n\nstatic void changeStringVariable(String message) {\n    System.out.println(\"message = \" + message);\n    message = \"Bye now!\";\n    System.out.println(\"message = \" + message);\n}\n\n\nhello = Hello World\nmessage = Hello World\nmessage = Bye now!\nhello = Hello World\n\n\nIt looks as if String behaves as a primitive!\nThat is NOT true! Strings are immutable. This means the you cannot change a String object; \nyou can only make a changed copy of it. In the above example, a new String object was created \nwithin method changeStringVariable(). The existing one was not changed but discarded.\nSummary\nYou have seen an overview of the Java primitives, and what you can do with them. \nThe concept of casting has been introduced. This casting can be implicit (from low \nto high information content), but when you try to go from high to low information \ncontent, with a possible loss of information, you must always cast or your code won't compile.This post has also outlined what reference types are, and what the difference between \nthese and primitives are.\nNext: arrays, the simplest form of collections.\n"},"02_syntax/naming_commenting.html":{"url":"02_syntax/naming_commenting.html","title":"Naming and commenting stuff","keywords":"","body":"Naming and commenting stuff\nAnyone who knows me (as a teacher) knows that (a) I really like Java and (b) I really really hate it when stuff gets named in the wrong way.\nNaming\nExperienced programmers can read code as if it is a nice book. When doing this, we rely on \nsome conventions, just like in real language. For instance, in regular human text, names start with a \ncapital, and sentences have a certain grammatical structure that makes it possible to read quickly without too much confusion. Whenever texts do not adhere to these rules or conventions, reading becomes very difficult.Programming languages are no different, and naming and layout-conventions help human readers to makes sense of it really quickly. \nJava has a concise set of naming rules that you should adopt from your first endeavors. Here are the most important ones.\nFor all names -classes, methods, variables- the single most important rule is that they should describe what they model in a precise and concise way.  For instance, a valid counter for te number of logins in a system could be c, count, counter or loginCounter, but only the last is really informative to anyone reading te code.  \nThe second general rule is that Java identifiers are always in CamelCase, with the exception of certain types of constants. Also, never start names with a number and do not use special characters! These are illegal and will not compile: 1forTheMoney, k#ller.\nClasses\nClass names should be a noun, in camel case, with the first letter capitalized. Here are a few good and bad examples for names of a class reading GFF data from a file:\nclass Read {} //bad - no noun and vague\nclass Reader {} //bad, vague\nclass DataReader {} //bad, still vague\nclass dataReader {} // bad - starts with lowercase\nclass Data_Reader {} // bad - underscore is not camelcase\nclass GffRead {} //bad, not a noun\nclass GffReader {} //good: a noun and specific\n\nMethods\nMethod names should be a verb, in camel case. Here some examples for a method name calculating the Euclidean distance between two Point objects:\ndouble d(Point otherPoint) {} //bad - no verb and vague\ndouble distance(Point otherPoint) {} // bad - no verb and still slightly vague\ndouble euclidean_distance(Point otherPoint) {} //bad, no camel case\ndouble EuclideanDistance(Point otherPoint) {} // bad - starts with uppercase character\ndouble euclideanDistance(Point otherPoint) {} // almost good, but no noun\ndouble getEuclideanDistance(Point otherPoint) {} //finally OK\n\nVariables\nVariable names should be nouns as well, but starting in lowercase:\ndouble r; //plain bad\ndouble ratio; //bad - what ratio?\ndouble Ratio; //bad - starts with uppercase\ndouble screen_ratio; //bad - underscore\ndouble screenAspectRatio; //good: noun and descriptive\n\nCommenting\nThere are three ways for commenting:  \n\nJavadoc style: /**\\*/ these are the most important because they end up in your documentation!\nmultiline comment /*\\*/\nsingle line comment //\\\n\nHere are some examples:\n/**\n * This is a Javadoc comment for the class: it describes what the class models and should be used for.\n * Also, version and author information can be put here.\n * @author Michiel\n * @version 0.1\n * */\npublic class Duck {\n    /**\n     * This is a Javadoc comment for a method.\n     * It should include tags for method arguments, exceptions and return types.\n     * @param loudness\n     */\n    public void quack(int loudness) {\n        //single-line logic comment\n        System.out.println(\"Quacking at level \" + loudness);\n        /*I can write a multiline block of\n        * comment like this*/\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of part of the the corresponding Javadoc html:\n\nI strongly encourage you to try this out for yourself: create a class, put some javadoc \ncomments in it and run \"Tasks -> documentation -> javadoc\" from the Gradle tool window.\nThe javadoc folder will be located in the build/docs/ folder.\nThe javadoc tool will issue warnings but proceed for some inconsistencies, but errors and abort for others.

However, arrays \ncertainly have their use when (memory) efficiency is an issue, or when you want \nto go multidimensional.\nOf course, the String array String[] args is the entry point of outside arguments into any \nJava program:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    for(int i = 0; i \nCreating arrays\nTo create an array, you have to specify what type it will hold, and how many elements\nit will hold. This can be done via:\n\npassing the size as a \"constructor\" argument\ndeclaring a literal\n\nHere are both ways for primitives and reference type elements.\n//create by specifying size - will contain zeros\nint[] numbers = new int[5];\n//create by specifying contents\ndouble[] scores = {2.1, 3.0, 4.5, 5.6};\n//create by specifying size - will contain nulls\nCell[] cells1 = new Cell[6];\n//create by specifying contents\nCell[] cells2 = {new Cell(), new Cell(), new Cell()};\n\nNote that when only the size is specified, the array will be filled with the type's default value, \nwhich is:\n\nfalse for boolean\nu0000 for char\n0 or 0.0 for numeric types (byte, short, int, long)\nnull for reference types\n\nAn array of primitives will actually contain the primitive values.\n\nAn array of objects will hold the references to the objects, not the objects themselves\n\nPrinting\nIf you want to print an entire array, use the method Arrays.toString():\nSystem.out.println(\"bytes = \" + Arrays.toString(bytes));\n\nAccessing\nTo get to an element of an array, you use an index.

It starts with an overview of all operators and ends \nwith a more detailed description of the less obvious ones.\nOverview\nOperators can be assigning (=), modifying, as in count++ and they \ncan be comparing, as in count . \nAnother way to classify them is to look at the number of operands they work on. They \ncan have one (unary - count++;), two (binary - count ) or \nthree (_ternairy- - (age > 65 ? old=true : old=false);) operands.\nOperators can be ordered by their precedence, which is the priority (order) in \nwhich they will be evaluated. \nint x = 41;\nint count = 1;\nint y = x + ++count;\nSystem.out.println(\"count=\" + count + \"; y=\" + y);\n\nThis snippet will output \"count=2; y=43\" because the pre-increment operator has \nprecedence over \"+\", and the assignment operator.\nHere is the complete listing. The associativity (Left-to-Right or Right-to-Left) of an operator \nis a property that determines how operators of the same precedence are grouped in the absence of \nparentheses. \n\nIn general, use the rule: \"When in doubt about precedence, always use parentheses\".\nThey always have the highest precedence, and improve readability a lot. Compare these \nwith respect to readability:\nx = y + z * 2 / Math.PI;\nx = y + ((z * 2) / Math.PI);\n\nAssignment operators\nNot all languages have such an extended set of assignment operators. \nWhen you want to change the value of a variable, you can use these shorthand assignment operators\nx = x + 2; is the same as x += 2;\nx = x + y; is the same as x += y;\nx = x * 3; is the same as x *= 3;\nx = x / 3; is the same as x /= 3;\nx = x % 3; is the same as x %= 3;\nThe last three are a bit esoteric in my opinion and I do not use them because they \nlower the readability of the code (especially %=).\nModulo: %\nThe modulo operator is also called the remainder operator; it gives the remainder of a division.\n10 % 3 -> 1 (one)\n8 % 5    -> 3\nThis operator is often used when even/uneven items need to be identified, or other periodic cases:\nthis will address every hundredth item:\nif (x % 100 == 0) {\n    /*deal with every hundredth item\n}\n\nTernary operator\nThe ternary operator is actually a condensed if..else block but can give more comprehensive code. \nif (age \nIt is often used for processing String tags, such as this one.\nString name = \"John Doe\";\nname += (academicTitle == null ? \", \" + academicTitle : \"\");\n\ninstanceof\nThe instanceof operator (keyword) is a boolean operator that will yield true of the left operand \nis the type of the right operand, or a subtype of it. Defining inheritance (subtypes) is done using the \nextends keyword. Here is an example.\nDog dog = new Dog();\nWolf wolf = new Wolf();\nChihuahua chihuahua = new Chihuahua();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"dog instanceof Animal = \" + (dog instanceof Animal));\nSystem.out.println(\"dog instanceof Object = \" + (dog instanceof Object));\nSystem.out.println(\"chihuahua instanceof Dog = \" + (chihuahua instanceof Dog));\nSystem.out.println(\"chihuahua instanceof Animal = \" + (chihuahua instanceof Animal));\nSystem.out.println(\"chihuahua instanceof Chihuahua = \" + (chihuahua instanceof Chihuahua));\n\noutputs\n\ndog instanceof Animal = true\ndog instanceof Object = true\nchihuahua instanceof Dog = true\nchihuahua instanceof Animal = true\nchihuahua instanceof Chihuahua = true\n\n\nbitwise operators\nJava also has some bitwise operators that are not described within this course.\n"},"02_syntax/flow_control.html":{"url":"02_syntax/flow_control.html","title":"Flow control","keywords":"","body":"Flow control\nThis is a straightforward listing of the Java flow control structures.\nif [else if] [else]\nIf/else is the basic decision-making mechanism in every programming language. \nIn Java, both \"else if\" and \"else\" are optional.\n\nif (condition) {} \n[else if (condition) {}]*\n[else {}]?\n\n\nSo, the \"if\" block is the required basis, \"else if\" can be used zero to many times - but only directly following the \"if\", and the entire statement is closed by an optional \"else\".\nSo this is not legal:\nif (foo) { }\nelse { }\nelse if (bar) { }\n\nand neither is this, because the int number = 2; interrupts the if/else block:\nif (foo) { }\nint number = 2;\nelse { }\n\nwhile\nWhile has two variants:\n\nwhile (condition) { } \ndo { } while (condition);\n\n\nThe difference is that do{}while() is guaranteed to be executed at least once, whereas while(condition) {} can be skipped entirely if \"condition\" is false at the first evaluation.\nfor\nIterates over a collection or a defined series of steps:\n\nfor (init; condition; change) { } \n\n\n\n\"init\" is the loop initialization; declaring a counter usually.\n\"condition\" is the test that determines whether the loop should run once more\n\"change\" is the iteration change; usually an increment of the init.\n\nThis is a typical for-loop:\nString[] nucleotides = {\"Adenine\", \"Cytosine\", \"Guanine\", \"Thymine\"};\nfor( int i = 0; i \nAll three elements are optional. This, for instance, is a legal for-loop:\nString[] nucleotides = {\"Adenine\", \"Cytosine\", \"Guanine\", \"Thymine\"};\nint i = nucleotides.length - 1;\nfor( ; i >= 0; --i) {\n    System.out.println(\"nucleotide \" + i + \" is \" + nucleotides[i]);\n}\n\nNote that the change does not need to be an increment.Even this one is legal:\nfor(;;) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello \");\n}\n\n//same as \nwhile(true) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n}\nBut it will run into eternity (or until ctrl + c has been typed). Actually, variations of the second form \nare quite often used to wait for user input in a terminal setting:\n while(true) {\n    int answer = getUserInput();\n    if (answer == 42) break;\n}\n\nforeach\nThe for-loop also has a variant. It is called the foreach loop. The difference is that there is no increment or condition; it is simply used to iterate a collection (Arrays or Collection types dealt with later).\n\nfor (element : collection) { } \n\n\nAnd this is a working example:\nString[] nucleotides = {\"Guanine\", \"Adenine\", \"Cytosine\", \"Thymine\"};\nfor( String nucleotide : nucleotides) {\n    System.out.println(\"nucleotide = \" + nucleotide);\n}\n\nbreak and continue\nAll iteration structures (the while while variants and both for variants) have the possibility to leave the current iteration early, or the loop entirely.\n\nbreak - leave the loop (or the switch block)\ncontinue - abort current iteration and go to next iteration\n\nswitch/case\nThe switch/case structure is a decision flow control structure that is always replaceable by if/else. However, \nswitch/case is often more efficient, and better suited to deal with choosing between different discrete options.\nWhere if/else works with boolean conditions, switch/case works with discrete cases.\nThe formal description is\n\nswitch (actual case) {\n    [case  case n: {case specific statement(s)}]*\n    [default: {default statement(s)}]?\n}\n\n\nSo there are one to many possible case-specific actions and zero or one default actions. \nHere is an example method using a switch/case:\nvoid switchCase(String country) {\n    switch (country) {\n        case \"Netherlands\":\n            System.out.println(\"Some weather, huh?\");\n            break;\n        case \"Belgium\":\n            System.out.println(\"It is Belgian fries!\");\n            break;\n        default:\n            System.out.println(\"Have a beer?\");\n    }\n}\n\nand when this is run like this\nFlowControlDemo demo = new FlowControlDemo();\ndemo.switchCase(\"Netherlands\");\n\nwe get this output\n\nSome weather, huh?\n\n\nand when called with an unknown country the default will be printed.\nNote the break keyword in each case. The break is a very important aspect of the switch block. \nA switch block is fall-through unless a break is encountered.\nSo if the breaks are removed from the switch\nvoid switchCase(String country) {\n    switch (country) {\n        case \"Netherlands\":\n            System.out.println(\"Some weather, huh?\");\n            //break;\n        case \"Belgium\":\n            System.out.println(\"It is Belgian fries!\");\n            //break;\n        default:\n            System.out.println(\"Have a beer?\");\n    }\n}\n\nwe get this output\n\nSome weather, huh?\nIt is Belgian fries!\nHave a beer?\n\n\nAlthough this seems rather illogical, there are uses for this behavior. For example, consider this error\nhandler for a web application:\nString errorMessage(int errorCode) {\n    String message;\n    switch (errorCode) {\n        case 401:\n        case 402:\n        case 403:\n        case 405:\n            message = \"You are trying to do something that is not allowed\";\n            break;\n        case 404:\n        case 503:\n            message = \"Resource not found\";\n            break;\n        default:\n            message = \"Some exotic error occurred.

Variables, operators and flow control \nform the basis of your algorithms. These algorithms have to be organized and combined into bigger \nsystems, and building systems is done using classes and their methods.\nMethods are pieces of code that are used as a \"black box\": you don't need to know how they work, as long as you know (and trust) what goes in and what comes out.\nIn Java, there exists quite a variety of method-like structures:\n\ninstance methods\nclass methods\nconstructors\nclass initializers\nobject initializers\n\nThis post only deals with the first two: class and instance methods.\nMethods define the behavior of an object or a class, modified by its state.\nMethods can unseen serve the inner workings of an object, or be available to the outside world: this is something you decide upon, and which is an extremely important design aspect!\nMethod signature\nEvery method has a signature. In Java, this is a binding contract.\nThe signature defines what can go in, what comes out, and what the method scope or visibility is.\nSo, the signature is the description of the method contract to the outside world: everything but its implementation (the method body).\nHere, the method signature is shown in red and the method body in blue.\n\npublic int addInts(int x, int y) {\n    int result = x + y;\n    return result;\n}\n\n\nZooming in on the signature, these are the signature elements:\n\naccess_modifier scope return_type methodName(parameter(s)) { }\n\n\naccess modifier: public or private?\nThe access modifier defines the visibility of your method. There are four levels of visibility, but we'll start out with only two:\n\npublic - accessible anywhere in the class path: all other code can \"see\" and access the method. \nprivate - accessible only within the same class\n\nWe'll come back to access modifiers later (see access modfiers), when discussing class design. This is because access modifiers can be applied not only to methods, but to classes and instance variables as well.\nThe general rule is this:Make a method public when it is part of your class API and make it private when it only serves the inner workings of your class\nScope: static vs instance methods\nSome methods live outside object scope and are only available as class methods: these can be recognized by the static keyword. Static methods can be called on a class and on an instance. Instance methods can only be called on an instance, usually because they are dependent on instance variable(s).\nYou have of course seen a static method several times: public static void main(String[] args){}\nHere are two methods that do the same, but are be used in different contexts.\nConsider this class:\n\npublic class StaticVsInstance {\n    /**\n     * static / class method\n     */\n    static int addIntsStatic(int x, int y) {\n        return x + y;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * instance method\n     */\n    int addIntsInstance(int x, int y) {\n        return x + y;\n    }\n}\n\nThe only difference lies in the static keyword. These are the different ways these methods can (not) be called:\n//only static can be called on the class\nStaticVsInstance.addIntsStatic(2, 5);\n//WILL NOT COMPILE: can not be called on a class\n//StaticVsInstance.addIntsInstance(3, 4);\n\nStaticVsInstance statInst = new StaticVsInstance();\n//BOTH can be called on an instance\nstatInst.addIntsStatic(5, 6);\nstatInst.addIntsInstance(3, 7);\n\nReturn type\nThe return type defines what a method can (and must) return. This can be any Java type; primitive or reference type. There is a special case when the method does not return anything: this is the void return type:\npublic void printWelcome (String name) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello, \" + name + \", we hope you enjoy our app.\");\n}\n\nReturning multiple values?Forget it! There is NO way you can return multiple values from a method.\nUnless...you put these values in a composite form. The following shows a legal but not very nice solution.\nNote the use of the varargs method parameter that enables you to let a method be called with a variable number of arguments of the same type.\n/**\n* Calculates the sum and average of a series of numbers and\n* returns this as an array with the sum at index 0 and the average at index 1\n* @param numbers\n* @return statistics\n*/\nstatic double[] doStatistics(int... numbers){ //VARARGS!\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int n : numbers) sum += n;\n    double average = (double)sum/numbers.length;\n    double[] result = {(double)sum, average};\n    return result;\n}\n\n//usage\nSystem.out.println(\"doStatistics(1, 2, 3) = \" + Arrays.toString(doStatistics(1, 2, 3)));\nSystem.out.println(\"doStatistics(1, 2, 3, 4) = \" + Arrays.toString(doStatistics(1, 2, 3, 4)));\n//outputs\n//doStatistics(1, 2, 3) = [6.0, 2.0]\n//doStatistics(1, 2, 3, 4) = [10.0, 2.5]\n\nWhy is this not nice? You coerce an int into a double where this is not appropriate. \nBesides this, you need extensive comments (documentation) to explain what is going on.\nTHINK OBJECTS!\n//a simple data class\nstatic class Statistics{\n    int sum;\n    double average;\n\n    //makes printing objects a breeze!\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Statistics{sum=\" + sum + \", average=\" + average + '}';\n    }\n}\n\n/**\n * the refactored method\n * Calculates the sum and average of a series of numbers and\n * returns this as an stats object\n * @param numbers\n * @return statistics\n */\nstatic Statistics doStatistics(int... numbers){\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int n : numbers) sum += n;\n    double average = (double)sum/numbers.length;\n    Statistics statistics = new Statistics();\n    statistics.sum = sum;\n    statistics.average = average;\n    return statistics;\n}\n\n//usage\nSystem.out.println(\"doStatistics(1,2,5,6) = \" + doStatisticsTheGoodWay(1, 2, 5, 6));\n//outputs\n//doStatistics(1,2,5,6) = Statistics{sum=14, average=3.5}\n\nThe toString() method is similar to the Python __str__() method. It will be discussed in detail later.\nMethod name\nThe name can be any compilable Java identifier, but as stated earlier it is good practice to have method names \n\nbe a noun, in camelcase starting with a lowercase letter\nbe as descriptive as possible\n\nParameters (versus arguments)\nThe method parameters are the number and type of variables that go in. Again, these can be of any valid Java \ntype.\nJava is pass-by-value. This means: pass-by-copy. Passing a reference means: pass a copy of the reference.\nThis reference copy will point to the same object as the original reference. This is sometimes confusing for \nbeginners:\nclass MyDataClass {\n    int x = 42;\n}\n\nvoid workWithClass(MyDataClass myDataClass) {\n    myDataClass.x++;\n}\n\n//usage \nMyDataClass myDataClass = new MyDataClass();\nSystem.out.println(\"myDataClass.x = \" + myDataClass.x);\nworkWithClass(myDataClass);\nSystem.out.println(\"myDataClass.x = \" + myDataClass.x);\n\n//outputs\n//myDataClass.x = 42\n//myDataClass.x = 43\n\nOn the difference between parameters and argumentsA parameter is the variable which is part of the method's signature (method declaration)\nAn argument is an expression used when calling the method.\nCheating the contract\nThis is not possible: the compiler won't let you get away with it. Here are some \nexamples showing what is legal and what isn't.\npublic class MyMathTools{\n\n    /*test the math function*/\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        MyMathTools mt = new MyMathTools();\n        //WON'T COMPILE: argument too little\n        mt.addInts(3);\n\n        //WON'T COMPILE: argument too many\n        mt.addInts(1, 2, 3);\n\n        //WON'T COMPILE: argument of wrong type\n        mt.addInts(2, \"foo\");\n\n        //WON'T COMPILE: double to int is loss-of-precision (unsafe)\n        mt.addInts(1.66, 2.33);\n\n        //WILL COMPILE; explicit cast (will return 1 + 2)\n        mt.addInts((int)1.66, (int)2.33);\n\n        //WILL COMPILE; int can be implicitly converted to double\n        addDoubles(2, 4)\n    }\n    public int addInts(int x, int y) {\n        return (x + y);\n    }\n\n    public double addDoubles(double x, double y) {\n        return (x + y);\n    }\n\n    public int addIntsWrong(int x, int y){\n        x + y;\n        //WON'T COMPILE: should return an int\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nInteracting with state\nThe essence of Object-oriented programming is that methods often interact with an object's state: they display behavior that is dependent on the value of the objects' instance variables. Here is a simple class that uses its state to modify method behavior.\nclass PowerUpper {\n    int power = 2;\n\n    int powerUp(int x) {\n        return (int)Math.pow(x, power);\n    }\n}\n\n//calling code\nPowerUpper powerUpper = new PowerUpper();\nSystem.out.println(\"4 ^ 2 = \" + powerUpper.powerUp(4));\npowerUpper.power = 3;\nSystem.out.println(\"4 ^ 3 = \" + powerUpper.powerUp(4));\n\noutputs:\n\n4 ^ 2 = 16\n4 ^ 3 = 64\n\n\nMethod overloading\nJava does not know about default parameter values. Fortunately, it can be implemented using a more flexible \nmechanism called method overloading. Method overloading is the implementation of multiple methods with the \nsame name and return type, but with different (numbers of) arguments. It is a bit of a hassle, but more versatile at the same time, since this not only supports default values but also extra pieces of algorithm code on top of default behavior.\nHere is an adjusted version of the PowerUpper class, implementing different overloading techniques.\nstatic class PowerUpper {\n    /**\n     * returns x ^ 2\n     */\n    int powerUp(int x) {\n        System.out.println(\"method A\");\n        return powerUp(x, 2);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * returns x ^ power\n     */\n    int powerUp(int x, int power) {\n        System.out.println(\"method B\");\n\n        //THIS WILL CAUSE A STACK OVERFLOW\n        //return powerUp(x, power);\n\n        //OK\n        return powerUp((double)x, (double)power);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * returns x ^ power from two doubles, but converts the result to int\n     */\n    int powerUp(double x, double power) {\n        System.out.println(\"method C\");\n        return (int)Math.pow(x, power);\n    }\n\n    //this is not an overload! a different return type\n    double powerUp(int x, double power) {\n        System.out.println(\"method D\");\n        return Math.pow(x, power);\n    }\n\n    //WON'T COMPILE! is not an overload, but a redefenition of \"int powerUp(double x, double power)\"\n    //double powerUp(double x, double power) {\n    //    return Math.pow(x, power);\n    //}\n}\n\n//usage\nPowerUpper powerUpper = new PowerUpper();\nSystem.out.println(\"4 ^ 2 = \" + powerUpper.powerUp(4));\nSystem.out.println(\"4 ^ 3 = \" + powerUpper.powerUp(4, 3));\nSystem.out.println(\"4.0 ^ 3.0 = \" + powerUpper.powerUp(4.0, 3.0));\nSystem.out.println(\"4.7 ^ 3.9 = \" + powerUpper.powerUp(4.7, 3.9));\n\nOutputs:\n\nmethod A\nmethod B\nmethod C\n4 ^ 2 = 16\nmethod B\nmethod C\n4 ^ 3 = 64\nmethod C\n4.0 ^ 3.0 = 64\nmethod C\n4.7 ^ 3.9 = 418\n\n"},"02_syntax/packages_imports.html":{"url":"02_syntax/packages_imports.html","title":"Packages & Imports","keywords":"","body":"Packages and Imports\nSo far, you may have stored all your class files inside a single source directory. For larger projects this will rapidly become a big unordered mess.\nBesides this, you will run into namespace problems: how many Sequence classes do you think are out there? How will the JVM be able to discern between them?\nClass path\nThe Classpath is a parameter in the Java Virtual Machine, and the Java compiler, that specifies the location of user-defined classes and packages. When you use a type (e.g., User, Duck, Nucleotide), the compiler and later the JVM look for classes that match the type name. The places where the search is performed are collectively known as the classpath.\nNamespaces\nA namespace is a context in  which a class name has meaning\nFor example, many Java applications have a class called User. How can the JVM know which of these classes to use if there are more to be found on the classpath?\nIn Java this is solved using packages.\nPackages\nAll serious Java projects have their code organized into packages.\nPackages are \"containers\" that keep related classes together and avoid name conflicts with classes with identical names.\nTo keep packages (and thus namespaces) unique, they are usually formed by reversing the programmer/company web address:\nnl.bioinf is a package name prefix I often use\nSince there are more programmers working behind nl.bioinf, I also add my teacher abbreviation: nl.bioinf.nomi.\nThe next level is the current project you work on, e.g. \"biojava light\", resulting in nl.bioinf.nomi.bjl.\nFinally, all sequence-related classes I put in package sequences. This gives a full package name nl.bioinf.nomi.bjl.sequences. This is a long name, but quite essential. Fortunately, you will hardly ever type them.\nMost of the core Java classes that you have worked with so far are in package java.lang.\nThe fully qualified name for class String is actually java.lang.String.\nFor classes in java.lang and the current package, you do not have to use the long package prefix.\nHave a look at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java.base-summary.html, find package java.lang and you will see all the familiar classes Double, String, Math, Character etc.\nPackages are represented in the directory structure of your source folder (src/main/java in Gradle managed projects).\nWhen you have a package nl.bioinf.sequences and this package contains a source file Sequence.java containg top-level class Sequence, you will have to place the class file of Sequence at:\n.../nl/bioinf/sequences/Sequence.class.\nThe IDE will takes care of these matters for you.\nWhen you use types that are not from java.lang or the same package (=directory) your current class is in, you will have to refer to them using a fully qualified name, or import them.  \nLet’s look at an example\npackage nl.bioinf.nomi.sequences;\n\npublic class Sequence{\n  //class code\n}\n\nClass Sequence is declared to be included in package nl.bioinf.nomi.sequences. Package declarations are placed on the first line of the source file, outside the class body. The actual folder/file structure inside your source folder will be like this:\n\nIf you don't use import statements, you will have to refer to classes using their fully qualified name, like this:\npackage nl.bioinf.nomi.sequences;\npublic class Sequence{\n\n  void somemethod(){\n    nl.bioinf.nomi.io.SequenceReader sr = new nl.bioinf.nomi.io.SequenceReader();\n  }\n  //more class code\n}\n\nWith import statements, this becomes much more readable:\npackage nl.bioinf.nomi.sequences;\n\nimport nl.bioinf.nomi.io.SequenceReader;\n\npublic class Sequence{\n\n  void somemethod(){\n    SequenceReader sr = new SequenceReader();\n  }\n  //more class code\n}\n\nImport statements are placed under the package declaration, also outside the class body.\nBecause of the import statement, the short class name SequenceReader can now be used inside this class \n"},"02_syntax/demo_case_naming.html":{"url":"02_syntax/demo_case_naming.html","title":"Demo case: The power of good names","keywords":"","body":"The power of naming\nAs a lecturer I am often confronted with code that does the job it was written \nand intended for, but still makes me want crawl in a corner and weep. \nThis often has to do with either one of these two aspects:\n\nCoding style  \nNaming\n\nThe first, coding style, has to do with how you organize/layout your \ncode, preferably in accordance with the conventions of your programming \nlanguage. The second aspect is how you name your variables, methods, \nclasses and packages (and projects). These two actually overlap to \nquite some extend, since coding style also has some things to say \nabout naming. \nLet’s have a look at some sample code that could have come straight \nfrom my classroom:  \npackage my_tool;\npublic class main {\n    public static void main(final String[] a) {\n        int Arg = Integer.parseInt(a[1]);\n        double opt=Double.parseDouble(a[2]);\n    parse p = new parse_impl();\n    Data d= p.reading(args[0]);\n    Calculate c = new Calculate();\n    c.Making(d,Arg, opt);\n  }\n}\n\nTake a minute and figure out what this code might do (I assure you it \ncompiles and executes correctly).\nTake another minute to figure out how many things are wrong with this \ncode. Hint: It is a lot.\nThis code is almost as cryptic as those nice little \nminified Javascript libraries. You know, when you refactor code to \nhave no comments, no whitespace except where absolutely \nnecessary, and have variables of 1 or 2 characters long. Below is \nthe same Java code minified:  \npackage my_tool;public final class M{public static void m(final String[]a)\n{int r=Integer.parseInt(a[1]);double o=Double.parseDouble(a[2];P p=new pi();D\nd=p.r(args[0]);C c=new C();c.m(d,r,o);}}\n\nAlthough this is really unintelligible, the first code fragment does not do a much better job at informing you. And that is exactly what good naming practice brings you: information. It informs you about\n\nWhat the classes are about (what they model)  \nWhat contract interfaces define  \nWhat the methods will likely be doing, and what the role of their arguments will have  \nWhat the purpose is of variables  \nWhat kind of entities everything refers to (classes, methods, variables)  \n\nWhenever you write code that should have meaning to others, or to yourself a \nfew months from now, use the above list as a mental review on your code.\nSo, what actually is wrong with the first code snippet? The coding style \nviolations are a pain to my eyes, so let’s get these out of the way \nfirst. Classes should start with an uppercase letter, be in camel case \nand be nouns, while methods should start with a lowercase letter, be \nverbs and also be in camel case. When you are into a programming language \nas much as I am into Java, you get really, really REALLY confused \nwhenever a class name starts with a lowercase letter! I’ll clean that \nup a little bit (and insert some much needed whitespace as well):  \npackage my_tool;\npublic final class Main {\n    public static void main(final String[] args) {\n        int arg = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);\n        double opt = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);\n        Parser p = new ParserImpl();\n        Data d = p.read(args[0]);\n        Calculator c = new Calculator();\n        c.make(d, arg, opt);\n    }\n}\n\nNone of the names give any clue about what the entities they refer \nto might be doing, except on the most generic level. Yes, “arg” is an \nargument and yes, ParseImpl is an implementation of the interface \nParser, but this tool may equally likely deal with interstellar dust \nreadings as with intracranial ultrasound measurements.

Classes have instance variables and methods acting on these. Here is an example.\npublic class Sequence {\n    String sequence;\n    String name;\n\n    /**\n     * returns the molecular weight, in Daltons\n     * @return weightInDaltons\n     */\n    double getMolecularWeight() {\n        double weight = 0;\n        //implementation to calculate weight\n        return weight;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Mutates a single position and returns a modified copy.\n     * This object itself is NOT mutated!\n     * @param position\n     * @param newCharacter\n     * @return mutatedSequence\n     */\n    Sequence mutate(int position, char newCharacter) {\n        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(this.sequence);\n        stringBuilder.setCharAt(position, newCharacter);\n        Sequence mutatedSequence = new Sequence();\n        mutatedSequence.sequence = stringBuilder.toString();\n        return mutatedSequence;\n    }\n}\n\nSo the contract (or API, if you like) of class Sequence is that it can deliver its molecular weight and can generate a mutated copy of itself. Both are concrete methods that are implemented with a method body. \nSometimes, however, you want to separate the contract from its implementation.\nA contract without implementation: interface\nMaybe you remember from Python the print() method. It has this signature  \nprint(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False).  \nBy default it writes to the console, sys.stdout, but you can change this \nbehavior as long as you pass an object with a write() method: print(\"foo\", file=object_with_a_write_method). \nTranslating this to Java, which is strongly typed, the print() method would \nexpect an object of a certain type, or contract, exposing a write() method.\nBut since there are so many different ways to write() data (to console, to \ndatabase, to socket), it would be impossible to create a single implementation that \nsupports all possible ways to write data, now and in the future.\nThe solution is to define a contract without implementation, separating the contract from the implementation. Classes interested in fulfilling the contract can sign up and define their own implementation, as long as the contract is followed to the letter. In Java, these contracts are called interfaces. Staying with the Python print() function, we would have to define a contract (interface) defining a \"write\" method that states \"give me your object and I will write it (to a destination of my choice)\":\nWhy is this useful? Let's move away from simple printing a bit. Suppose we have a SequenceCollection class that \nexposes a flush() method, that is supposed to write the held collection \nto an external location for storage and clear memory to be ready for \nfilling: A typical case of batch processing. But the \nSequenceCollection class does not know which storage technology is \npreferred by its clients (API programmers), so it only asks API programmers \nto provide it with an object implementing the SequenceWriter contract. \nFirst, here is the SequenceWriter interface.\npackage snippets.apis;\n\npublic interface SequenceWriter {\n    /**\n     * This is the sole method defined in this interface. It accepts an\n     * object and will store a representation of it to an external destination.\n     * @param sequence the sequence to store\n     */\n    void store(Sequence sequence); //NO METHOD BODY; ONLY A SIGNATURE!\n}\n\nThe store() method does not have a method body - it only serves as a contract. \nHere is the SequenceCollection class the \"talks to\" only the contract - it has no clue what kind of implementation it receives.\npackage snippets.apis;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class SequenceCollection{\n    private List sequences = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addSequence(Sequence sequence) {\n        this.sequences.add(sequence);\n    }\n\n    public void removeSequence(Sequence sequence) {\n        this.sequences.remove(sequence);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This will write the current SequenceCollection to an external destination\n     * and empty the collection to be filled with a next batch.\n     * @param writer the writer that processes each individual sequence object\n     */\n    public void flush(SequenceWriter writer) {\n        for (Sequence seq : this.sequences) {\n            //NO CLUE OF THE ACTUAL STORAGE IMPLEMENTATION\n            //ONLY KNOWS THERE IS AN OBJECT LIVING UP TO TO THE CONTRACT\n            writer.store(seq);\n        }\n        this.sequences.clear();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Looks for pathogenic sequences in the current batch\n     * @return pathogenicSequences\n     */\n    public List findPathogenicSequences() {\n        ArrayList pathogenics = new ArrayList<>();\n        //complex logic\n        return pathogenics;\n    }\n\n    //MORE LOGIC INVOLVING THIS SEQUENCE COLLECTION\n}\n\nSo now, if we want to use this SequenceCollection class, we need to provide it with an implementer of the contract. Here are two.\nWhen you create a class in IntelliJ, and type implements SequenceWriter, you get a compile error, saying \"Class X must either .... or implement method Y\":\n\nPlace the cursor on the line with the class name, press alt + Enter and select \"Implement methods\".

This mechanism is called generics in Java, because it makes collection classes generic usable.\nBefore Java 8, you had to do it twice (ArrayList sequences = new ArrayList();) but in newer versions of Java you can leave the second set of diamond operators empty. \nLeaving the type declaration out does not yield a compiler error, but makes your life so much harder:\n//typed collection\nArrayList words = new ArrayList<>();\nwords.add(\"Game\");\nwords.add(\"of\");\nwords.add(\"Thrones\");\n\n//type is inferred from collection\nfor (int i = 0; i \nSo, without the type declaration, you need to cast to the actual type. That makes your code less obvious. But more problematic is that any object can be inserted into the collection, without warning. So, when you attempt to cast a Duck to a String, you get a ClassCastException. You can circumvent this problem by checking the type (using the instanceof operator):\nfor (int i = 0; i \nbut why would you make your life harder than it already is?\nArrayList operations\nLists in general, and ArrayList is no exception, are used to store in an ordered way. Operations on ArrayLists are of course related to the property. Here are some example usages.\n//create\nArrayList words = new ArrayList<>();\n//add elements\nwords.add(\"Game\");\nwords.add(\"of\");\nwords.add(\"Thrones\");\n//won't compile!\n//words.add(new Duck());\n\n//foreach iteration\nfor (String word : words) {\n    System.out.println(\"word = \" + word);\n}\n\n//iteration with counter; note the use of \".size()\"\nfor (int i = 0; i \nOne operation needs special attention: converting an array to a List. This is done with Arrays.asList() but be aware that this generates an immutable view of your array:\nString[] wordsArr = {\"Lord\", \"of\", \"the\", \"Rings\"};\n//create immutable List from Array\nList immutableStrings = Arrays.asList(wordsArr);\n//immutable: UnsupportedOperationException!\nimmutableStrings.add(\"!\");\n//make mutable copy\nList mutableString = new ArrayList<>();\n//no problem\nmutableString.add(\"!\");\n\nCode against interfaces, not implementations\nBe aware that the contains() method performs at O(n) (see your Algorithms & Data structures course!), so if you plan to check for\nelement presence often, List types are not a good choice. Also, if you are going to do a lot of insert and/or delete operations, LinkedList is a much better choice. Fortunately, you only need to change one line of code in your application to achieve this, and if you design your code well, you only need to change a single word:\n//This is OK but not efficient with insert/delete \n//Also, the type declaration is an implementation (ArrayList) and not an \n//interface (List)\nArrayList words = new ArrayList<>();\n\n//Better, declare the interface (abstraction) type and \n//use this type in the rest of your code\nList words = new ArrayList<>();\n\n//Best: LinkedList is very good at insertions and deletions\nList words = new LinkedList<>();\n\nThis is an example of the rule code against interfaces (abstractions), not implementations.\nWhen you code against interfaces, i.e. declare variables of an interface type, it is really easy to change the implementation class that you use.\nIn the example above, \nit took only one changes word to use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList.\nThe collection interfaces: Map, List, Set\nThere four base collection types, each with several dedicated implementations.\nYou have already seen the List type, with two implementations: ArrayList and LinkedList. \nHere is a -very incomplete- listing of some collection type implementations, \nfollowed by a demonstration of only the HashMap and HashSet types - you have already seen the List type. \n\nList interface  \nArrayList simplest and general purpose list type\nLinkedList coupled elements\nStack last in first out (LIFO)\n\n\nMap interface  \nHashMap the Python dict equivalent\nTreeMap a sorted hashmap\n\n\nSet interface  \nHashSet the basic Set implementation\nTreeSet a sorted Set\n\n\nQueue interface\nPriorityQueue priority queue when first in first out (FIFO) is not enough\nArrayDeque double-ended queue\n\n\n\nMap: HashMap\nHashMap is the main Map implementation in Java. It is a dictionary type mapping keys to values. Like all collection types, it uses generics to declare the type of the keys and values. Here is an example of an ID to User mapping:\n\nMap users = new HashMap<>();\n\n\nNote the use of Integer instead of int. \nPrimitives as objects\nEach primitive type in the Java language has an object counterpart. The reason for this is that collection types, amongst others, can not hold primitives but only objects.\nThese are the primitives and their wrapper classes:\n\nboolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double.\nBoolean, Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float, Double.\n\nSo only Character and Integer have a different name (longer) the others are simply the primitive name capitalized.\nAutoboxing\nThe wrapper classes can be converted to and from pretty easy:\nint count = 33;\n\n//deprecated though legal\nInteger counter1 = new Integer(count);\n//Explicit; uses caching\nInteger counter2 = Integer.valueOf(count);\n//explicit unwrapping\ncounter2.intValue();\n\n//autoboxing!\nInteger counter3 = count;\n//auto-unboxing\nint counter4 = counter3;\n\nThe last two examples show the mechanism of autoboxing primitives. \nThis means the compiler deals with wrapping and unwrapping for you. This is how you typically use primitives in collections. See use cases below.\nMap operations\nSee listing below.\nMap users = new HashMap<>();\nUser u1 = new User(15, \"Henk\");\n//add to Map; note autoboxing of int value (id)\nusers.put(u1.id, u1);\nUser u2 = new User(21, \"Dirk\");\nusers.put(u2.id, u2);\nUser u3 = new User(9, \"Mike\");\nusers.put(u3.id, u3);\n\n//read size\nSystem.out.println(users.size());\n//check for presence of key\nSystem.out.println(\"users.containsKey(15) = \" + users.containsKey(15));\n//check for presence of value\nSystem.out.println(\"users.containsValue() = \" + users.containsValue(u1));\n//is not in map\nSystem.out.println(\"users.containsValue() = \" + users.containsValue(new User(6, \"Nick\")));\n\n//iterate values\nfor (User user : users.values()) { }\n\n//iterate keys\nfor (int id : users.keySet()) { }\n\n//iterate entries\nfor (Map.Entry entry : users.entrySet()) {\n    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n\n//empties map\nusers.clear();\n\nSet: HashSet\nTypical set operations are intersection, union and relative complement. \n\nThis is how its done in Java.\nFirst a small utility method, which generically creates a Set of any type from a varargs input:\nprivate static  Set setOf(T... values) {\n    return new HashSet(Arrays.asList(values));\n}\n\nHere are three of the fundamental set operations.\nSet setA = setOf(1, 2, 3, 4);\nSet setB = setOf(2, 4, 6, 8, 9);\n\n//Intersection\nSet intersectSet = new HashSet<>(setA);\nintersectSet.retainAll(setB);\nSystem.out.println(\"intersectSet = \" + intersectSet);\n\n//Union\nSet unionSet = new HashSet<>(setA);\nunionSet.addAll(setB);\nSystem.out.println(\"unionSet = \" + unionSet);\n\n//Relative complement\nSet differenceSet = new HashSet<>(setA);\ndifferenceSet.removeAll(setB);\nSystem.out.println(\"differenceSet = \" + differenceSet);\n\nwith output\n\nintersectSet = [2, 4]\nunionSet = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]\ndifferenceSet = [1, 3]\n\n\nCollections utility methods\nThe Collections class has many useful utility functions. Their name are pretty self-explanatory:\n\nsingletonList()\nunmodifiableList()\nmin(), max()\nshuffle()\nfrequency()\nsort() - see next post\n\n"},"03_apis/class_object_methods.html":{"url":"03_apis/class_object_methods.html","title":"toString(), equals() and hashCode()","keywords":"","body":"Methods of class Object\ntoString(), equals(), hashCode(), getClass()\nPreviously you have seen some collection types: List, Map, Set. \nOne of the methods that is universal to all collection types is contains(). \nHow does the JVM determine that two objects are equal?\nThis is through the equals() method.\nWhen you use the statement myCollection.contains(myObject), you get true returned if one of the elements in myCollection returns true for element.equals(myObject).\nThe method equals() is there, even though you did not implement it. This is because they are declared and implemented in class Object, and every class in Java extends from Object implicitly. Whenever you create a class, such as this:\nclass User {\n\n}\n\nyou get this implicitly:\nclass User extends Object {\n\n}\n\nSince User extends Object, it inherits all Object properties and methods. If you create an object (of any type), type the variable name followed by a dot, IntelliJ will show you the methods of class Object:\n\nThe notify..() and wait..() methods have to do with multithreading and are not dealt with here. \nThe ones of interest are\n\ntoString() returns a String representation of the current object. Implemented in class Object as the objects' memory hash.\nequals() returns a boolean indicating whether the argument \nis logically the same as the current object. Implemented in class Object as: true if both refer to the same object.\nhashCode() returns the hashCode (an int) of the current object. Implemented in class Object to return an integer representing the objects memory address.\ngetClass() returns the class of the current object\n\ntoString(): a string representation of the object\nIf you want to see a nice textual representation of an object during software development, you use toString(). \nIn IntelliJ, type ctrl + O if you want to override a super class method.\n\nIf you choose toString(), you'll get something like this:\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return super.toString();\n}\n\nNote the @Override annotation. \nAnnotations are syntactic sugar in Java, and this one says to the compiler: \nplease check whether this override is correct, else fail compilation.\nCorrect with respect to toString() means: take no arguments and return a String.\nThe statement return super.toString(); simply states: call the super class toString (of Object in this case) and return its result. Which means you get the uninformative:\nsnippets.apis.User@78b1cc93\nTo make toString useful, you'll need te redefine its logic, for instance:\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"A user with name \" + name;\n}\n\nwhich outputs A user with name Henk\nAlthough this is logically correct, and will compile just fine, there are some conventions used in Java to be informative. To get a toString() which follows this rule, use another IntelliJ shortcut: ctrl + N (for generate code), and select toString().\n\nThen, select the instance variables you want included in the string representation, click OK and you have something like this\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"User{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            '}';\n}\n\noutputting User{id=15, name='Henk'}, which is a good textual representation of the underlying object.\nequals() determining logical similarity between objects\nConsider these three User objects, where the first constructor argument is the user ID and the second the username.\nUser user1 = new User(15, \"Henk\");\n//same, equal?\nUser user2 = user1;\n\nUser user3 = new User(21, \"Dirk\");\n//same, or equal User as user3?\nUser user4 = new User(21, \"Dirk\");\n\nIs user1 equal to user2? Is user1 equal to itself, user1? Is user3 equal to user4?There is an important distinction to be made: equality versus sameness. \nTwo references are considered the same if they both point to a single object on the heap. \nOn the other hand, equality is a more fuzzy concept. In general, we consider \ntwo references equal if they point either to one single object,\nor to two distinct objects that are logically similar.\nSo, in the above code snippet, user1 is definitely the same as user two since they refer to the same object. \nBut since they are the same, they must therefore also be equal.On the other hand, user3 and user4 are two distinct objects (the constructor has run twice!), \nbut logically similar because they have exactly the same internal data.\nIn Java, == tests for sameness and equals() for logical similarity.\nTherefore, we would like our User class to behave like this.\nSystem.out.println(\"user1 == user1 -- \" + (user1 == user1)); //should be true\nSystem.out.println(\"user1.equals(user1) -- \" + user1.equals(user1)); //should be true\nSystem.out.println(\"user1 == user2 -- \" + (user1 == user2)); //should be true\nSystem.out.println(\"user1.equals(user2) -- \" + user1.equals(user2)); //should be true\nSystem.out.println(\"user1.equals(user3) -- \" + user1.equals(user3)); //should be false\nSystem.out.println(\"user3.equals(user4) -- \" + user3.equals(user4)); //should be true!\n\nbut in actuality this is what we get\n\nuser1 == user1 -- true\nuser1.equals(user1) -- true\nuser1 == user2 -- true\nuser1.equals(user2) -- true\nuser1.equals(user3) -- false\nuser3.equals(user4) -- false\n\n\nUp to the last test, everything works out fine. Why does the last test return false? Because Java doesn't not know about logical similarity between User objects! We have to tell it. Therefore, by default this is what the Object.equals() method does:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object other) {\n    return (this == other);\n}\n\nLet's change the equals() method to reflect (my opinion of) similarity:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object other) {\n    User otherUser = (User) other;\n    return (this.id == otherUser.id && this.name == otherUser.name);\n}\n\nThere is a lot to say about this implementation. Can you spot the flaws?\nThere are several, so maybe it is better to let IntelliJ handle this for us, via ctrl + N (generate) -> equals() and hashCode() -> choose template (Java 7+), choose name and ID --> next, next next, Finish:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    User user = (User) o;\n    return id == user.id &&\n            Objects.equals(name, user.name);\n}\n\nStudy this carefully! Why is each statement inserted?\nThe equals() method must exhibit the following properties:  \n\nSymmetry: For two references, a and b, a.equals(b) if and only if b.equals(a) as well\nReflexivity: For all non-null references, a.equals(a)\nTransitivity: If a.equals(b) and b.equals(c), then a.equals(c)\nConsistency with hashCode(): Two equal objects must have the same hashCode() value\n\nhashCode(): required when equals() is implemented\nThe hashCode() method is kind of the mysterious sister of equals(). You implement them together, but only equals() is easily understood. \nThe hashCode() method is used for bucketing in Hash implementations like HashMap, HashTable, HashSet, etc.\nThe value received from hashCode() is used as the bucket number for storing elements of the set/map. \nThis bucket number is the address of the element inside the set/map.\nWhen you do contains() it will take the hash code of the element, then look for the bucket where hash code points to. \nIf more than 1 element is found in the same bucket (multiple objects can have the same hash code), \nthen it uses the equals() method to evaluate if the objects are equal, and then decide \nif contains() is true or false, or decide if element could be added in the set or not.\n(This paragraph is copied from a post on Stackoverflow)\nThe general contract of hashCode() states:  \n\nWhenever it is invoked on the same object more than once, hashCode() must consistently return the same value, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This value needs not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application\n\nIf two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode() method on each of the two objects must produce the same value\n\nIt is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, developers should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects improves the performance of hash tables\n\n\nOf course, we let IntelliJ do the hard work (ctrl + N):\n@Override\npublic int hashCode() {\n    //uses a utility method from class Objects\n    return Objects.hash(id, name);\n}\n\ngetClass() gives meta-information the objects class\nExample code is best here:\nSystem.out.println(\"user1.getClass().getSimpleName() = \" + user1.getClass().getSimpleName());\nSystem.out.println(\"user1.getClass().getName() = \" + user1.getClass().getName());\nSystem.out.println(\"user1.getClass().getPackageName() = \" + user1.getClass().getPackageName());\n\noutputs\n\nuser1.getClass().getSimpleName() = User\nuser1.getClass().getName() = snippets.apis.User\nuser1.getClass().getPackageName() = snippets.apis\n\n\nThere are a lot more methods in class java.lang.Class, but they serve difficult stuff, like introspection.\n"},"03_apis/sorting.html":{"url":"03_apis/sorting.html","title":"Sorting","keywords":"","body":"Sorting\nSorting is one of the fundamental operations on data. You want the best student, the closest cafe, all players with a top 10% ranking...this all involves sorting.\nSorting in \"classic\" Java (not using the Streams API) is done using the the Collections.sort() methods. These methods require either (a) that the objects you want to sort implement the Comparable interface or (b) that you provide a sorter object implementing the Comparator interface.\n\"Natural\" sorting: implement the Comparable interface\nThis is the first sort() method. Its signature is rather complex, but fortunately using it is not.\n\npublic static > void sort(List list)\n\n\nThis signature tells us a lot: \n\nit is static, so it can be used directly on the Collections class\nit has void as return type, so it sorts a list in place instead of returning a sorted copy.\nit takes as argument a List \nthe elements of the list are of type T (a generic placeholder), where the constraint on type T is that it should implement the Comparable interface - more specifically: a Comparable comparing T or its supertypes. \n\nKey here is the Comparable interface (package java.util):\npackage java.util;\npublic interface Comparable {\n    int compareTo(T other);\n}\n\nThe contract is really simple. To be comparable to other objects (of the same class), a class needs to implement the method compareTo(T other) where T is the class implementing the interface. The method signature of compareTo() states that it should receive an instance of T and return an integer indicating the sort order of the current object with respect to the other object. The convention for this return value is  \n\na negative value if this other\nzero if this equals that\na positive value if this > other\n\nLet's create a first implementation and demonstrate its use.\nHere is a simple Bird class. \npackage snippets.apis;\n\npublic class Bird {\n    String englishName;\n    double wingSpan;\n    int maximumAge;\n\n    public Bird(String englishName, double wingSpan, int maximumAge) {\n        this.englishName = englishName;\n        this.wingSpan = wingSpan;\n        this.maximumAge = maximumAge;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Bird{\" +\n                \"englishName='\" + englishName + '\\'' +\n                \", wingSpan=\" + wingSpan +\n                \", maximumAge=\" + maximumAge +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n\nThe first thing you need to figure out when implementing sorting is what is the natural sort order of this class?\nThis depends entirely on you application: which aspect of your class will be used primarily for sorting. In this case, I choose the wingSpan property.\nNext, these steps should be taken:\n\nDeclare your class as implementer of the Comparable contract\nCreate the method stub.\nImplement the logic\n\nStep 2 is done by IntelliJ once you've done 1 and selected te context menu (alt + enter):\n\nSelect the single method and press enter. This is the result.\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(Bird other) {\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis compiles just fine, but logic is missing. The next snipped solves that.\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(Bird other) {\n    //declare named variables for readability\n    final int BEFORE = -1;\n    final int EQUAL = 0;\n    final int AFTER = 1;\n    //compare\n    if(this.wingSpan = other.wingSpan) return AFTER;\n    else return EQUAL;\n}\n\nTime for a test drive. The toString method was adjusted for readability and compactness. Also, a Java8+ feature (Streams API) was used for printing (not part of this courses' material).\nList birds = new ArrayList<>();\n\nbirds.add(new Bird(\"Buzzard\", 1.3, 29));\nbirds.add(new Bird(\"Griffon vulture\", 2.6, 25));\nbirds.add(new Bird(\"Kestrel\", 0.35, 15));\nbirds.add(new Bird(\"Red kite\", 1.8, 23));\nbirds.add(new Bird(\"Steppe eagle\", 2.1, 41));\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Before:\");\n//prints addition order using Java8 streams\nbirds.stream().forEach(bird -> System.out.println(\"\\t\" + bird));\nCollections.sort(birds);\nSystem.out.println(\"After sort on wingspan:\");\n//prints sort order on wingspan, ascending\nbirds.stream().forEach(bird -> System.out.println(\"\\t\" + bird));\n\noutputs\n\nBefore:\n    Buzzard', ws=1.3, max.age=29\n    Griffon vulture', ws=2.5, max.age=25\n    Kestrel', ws=0.35, max.age=15\n    White-tailed eagle', ws=2.5, max.age=25\n    Red kite', ws=1.8, max.age=23\n    Steppe eagle', ws=2.1, max.age=41\nAfter sort on wingspan:\n    Kestrel', ws=0.35, max.age=15\n    Buzzard', ws=1.3, max.age=29\n    Red kite', ws=1.8, max.age=23\n    Steppe eagle', ws=2.1, max.age=41\n    Griffon vulture', ws=2.5, max.age=25\n    White-tailed eagle', ws=2.5, max.age=25\n\n\nNote the ascending order of wingspan. What if the natural order is descending in your opinion? Simply reverse the sort logic:\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(Bird other) {\n    final int BEFORE = -1;\n    final int EQUAL = 0;\n    final int AFTER = 1;\n    if(this.wingSpan = other.wingSpan) return BEFORE;\n    else return EQUAL;\n}\n\noutputs\n\nAfter:\n    Griffon vulture', ws=2.6, max.age=25\n    Steppe eagle', ws=2.1, max.age=41\n    Red kite', ws=1.8, max.age=23\n    Buzzard', ws=1.3, max.age=29\n    Kestrel', ws=0.35, max.age=15\n\n\nAlthough this sort logic is just fine, it is often better to use classes that are dedicated to dealing with the datatype and delegate to their implemented and tested methods:\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(Bird other) {\n    //delegate to class double\n    return Double.compare(this.wingSpan, other.wingSpan);\n}\n\nSorting objects using a custom Comparator\nWhat if you want to sort in other ways as well, or if you do not want to settle on a natural sort order? Then there is the second form of the Collections.sort() method:\n\npublic static  void sort(List list, Comparator c)\n\n\nThe big difference is that you provide a Comparator object, instead of having the sort() method compare your objects directly.\nThe Comparator interface has a single abstract method:\npackage java.util\n\npublic interface Comparator {\n    int compare(T one, T two);\n}\n\nThere are many ways to implement interfaces. Let's start with the most straightforward one.\npackage snippets.apis;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\npublic class BirdNameComparator implements Comparator {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Bird first, Bird second) {\n        return first.englishName.compareTo(second.englishName);\n    }\n}\n\nThis one sorts on name, and again delegates to the type of the instance variable - class String. This is its usage.\nCollections.sort(birds, new BirdNameComparator());\n\nImplementations of the Comparator interface are often created on-the-fly. For instance, look at this anonymous inner class.\nCollections.sort(birds, new Comparator(){\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Bird first, Bird second) {\n        return Integer.compare(first.maximumAge, second.maximumAge);\n    }\n});\n\nActually, since Java8, sorting has become much versatile, but you need to climb the learning curve of lambdas first:\n//Java8+ alternative: OK\nCollections.sort(birds, (birdOne, birdTwo) -> Integer.compare(birdOne.maximumAge, birdTwo.maximumAge));\n//Java8+ alternative: best\nCollections.sort(birds, Comparator.comparingInt(bird -> bird.maximumAge));\n\nMultilevel sorting\nThe final part of this post does not deal with the API but with the logic to implement it. You have seen how to code simple comparison logic. But what if you want to sort on multiple properties? Suppose, in the case of the birds example, we wanted to sort on wingspan first and then on name.\nNo matter how many properties, the pattern is always the same: check the primary property, return this if they are not equal. If they are equal, check on the secondary property:\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(Bird other) {\n    int compareWingSpan = Double.compare(this.wingSpan, other.wingSpan);\n    if (compareWingSpan == 0) {\n        return this.englishName.compareTo(other.englishName);\n    }\n    return compareWingSpan;\n}\n\nNote that with alphabetical sorting capitals come before lower case letters. This is because the numeric values of the table of ASCII codes are used:\n\n"},"03_apis/exceptions.html":{"url":"03_apis/exceptions.html","title":"Exceptions","keywords":"","body":"Exceptions\nBefore dealing with file IO, exceptions need to be discussed. You need to deal with exceptions whenever you deal with the outside world. Why? The outside world is dangerous and unpredictable: files do not exist, or are not accessible to you, internet connections can be down, a database has a new password or URL...\nAll these scenarios will throw an Exception your way. It is up to you, the application programmer, to catch them and deal with them. Either by following an alternative program path, or to quit the application elegantly.\nExceptions are method return values that do not follow regular program flow; they are instantiated when something goes wrong and usually cause the program to behave differently.\nWhat are exceptions\nConsider this code.\npackage snippets.apis;\n\npublic class ExceptionsDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        doFirst();\n    }\n\n    private static void doFirst() {\n        doSecond();\n    }\n\n    private static void doSecond() {\n        int x = 42 / 0;\n    }\n}\n\nRunning main() will generate an error resulting in a stacktrace:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\n    at snippets.apis.ExceptionsDemo.doSecond(ExceptionsDemo.java:13)\n    at snippets.apis.ExceptionsDemo.doFirst(ExceptionsDemo.java:9)\n    at snippets.apis.ExceptionsDemo.main(ExceptionsDemo.java:5)\n\n\nThe error - the fact that a number cannot be divided by zero - occurs in method doSecond() and this will cause the JVM to generate an Exception. In this case, an ArithmeticException. The stack trace starts with the method where the error originated, and works its way down to main() from where the application \"crashes\" because the exception was not caught/resolved by program logic.  \nThe Exception object is thrown from this point down the call stack unless it is caught.  \nThe name \"stacktrace\" refers to the call stack or stack of execution. A call stack is a data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.\nThe current executing function is always on top.\nWhen an exception or error occurs, you will see a traceback through this stack, from the top (where the error occurred) back to the main() function.\nThis gives you information about the origin and nature of the error.\nChecked and unchecked exceptions\nAlthough the name Exception was used in this example, there are actually quite a few in the Java API. They are all related to each other through inheritance. The base type of all is class Throwable. It has two children: Error and Exception. See figure below.\n\nThere are exceptions for standard IO operations. These are called checked exceptions because their fate is checked by the compiler: whenever you call a method throwing one of these, you must catch it, or add a throws clause to your method. There is a subbranch extending from RuntimeException that represent the unchecked exceptions. These are not checked by the compiler: you can throw or catch these explicitly, but that is not required.\nChecked exceptions\nWhenever a method publishes a throws clause of a checked exception in its method signature, you must take one of these two courses of action:\n\nCatch it yourself: place this code in a try/catch structure\n  try { \n      /*do the risky thing*/ \n  } catch (Exception e) {\n      /*solve the problem*/ \n  }\n\n\nMake other code solve the problem: place a throws clause in the method signature:\n\n\n    public void doRisky() throws Exception { \n        /*risky method body*\n    }\n\nYou should use the Exception hierarchy to make a robust error-handling backbone in your application. Have a look at this basic example and read the code comments carefully.\npackage snippets.apis;\n\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class MyAppWithExceptions {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        MyAppWithExceptions app = new MyAppWithExceptions();\n        app.start();\n    }\n\n    private void start() {\n        try {\n            loadDatabase();\n            readFile(\"some_file\");\n            processData();\n            writeResults(\"results_file\");\n        } catch (IOException | SQLException e) {\n            Logger.getLogger(\"MyApp\").log(Level.SEVERE, \"IO error!\", e);\n            System.err.println(\"An error occurred. See the log for details.\");\n            //don't use stacktrace in production!\n            //e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void processData() {\n        try {\n            //processing file data\n        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n            //note this is an unchecked exception; \n            //the try/catch is optional\n            Logger.getLogger(\"MyApp\").log(Level.INFO, \"Number format problem\", e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void writeResults(String resultsFile) throws FileAlreadyExistsException {\n        //write to results file\n    }\n\n    private void loadDatabase() throws SQLException {\n        //loading MySQL DB\n    }\n\n    private void readFile(String someFile) throws FileNotFoundException {\n        //reading input data\n    }\n}\n\nUnchecked exceptions\nUnchecked exceptions are quite similar to checked exceptions, but with the difference that you do not \n\nneed to declare them\nneed to try/catch or throw them explicitly.\n\nUnchecked exceptions include NumberFormatException, NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException and UnsupportedOperationException. In modern Java, unchecked exceptions are preferred above checked exceptions. Try to work with these as much as possible.\nErrors\nYou should never ever try to catch errors. There is no possible use case for that:\ntry {\n    thirdMethod();\n} catch (OutOfMemoryError error) {\n    //recover from an out-of-memory error?\n}\n\nAll try/catch elements\nHere are all the try/catch flow control elements. Note that the supertype of more specific exceptions need to be caught last, after the specific types.\ntry{\n    /*The risky thing. \n    This block will run until an exception occurs \n    - also exceptions that are not explicitly caught*/\n} catch (FileNotFoundException |\n    EndOfFileException ex) {\n    /*Deal with some specific file problems*/\n} catch(IOException ex) {\n    /*IOException is supertype to FileNotFoundException and EndOfFileException.\n    Deal with all other IO problems in this catchall*/\n} catch(SQLException ex) {\n    /*Deal with database problems. \n    SQLException is a sibling to IOException*/\n}\nfinally {\n    /*Always runs, exception or not!  \n    Do things that need to be done, no \n    matter what, like closing a file or \n    database connection*/\n}\n\nTry-with resources\nJava 7 introduced the try-with resources structure, which automatically closes the resource once the try block has finished:\ntry () { }\ncatch () { }\n\nThis form assures that a resource will be closed() after the try{} block exits, with or without error. See the post on IO for its usage.\n"},"03_apis/io.html":{"url":"03_apis/io.html","title":"File IO","keywords":"","body":"File IO\nAlmost all applications work on external data – files, databases and internet resources.Here we will only have a look at files. \nPath & Paths\nThese classes represent storage locations, not the files themselves. They are useful for quite a number of things. Here are a few.\nString fileName = \"/Users/michiel/IdeaProjects/JavaIntroProgrammingAssignments/data/proteins.fa\";\n\nPath path = Paths.get(fileName);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"path = \" + path);\nSystem.out.println(\"path.getParent() = \" + path.getParent());\nSystem.out.println(\"path.getRoot() = \" + path.getRoot());\nSystem.out.println(\"path.subpath(0,3) = \" + path.subpath(0, 3));\nSystem.out.println(\"path.getFileName() = \" + path.getFileName());\n//convert to File object\nFile file = path.toFile();\n\nwill output\npath = /Users/michiel/IdeaProjects/JavaIntroProgrammingAssignments/data/proteins.fa\npath.getParent() = /Users/michiel/IdeaProjects/JavaIntroProgrammingAssignments/data\npath.getRoot() = /\npath.subpath(0,3) = Users/michiel/IdeaProjects\npath.getFileName() = proteins.fa\nFile and Files\nClass Files has typical utility methods:\nString fileName = \"/Users/michiel/IdeaProjects/JavaIntroProgrammingAssignments/data/proteins.fa\";\n\nPath path = Paths.get(fileName);\nSystem.out.println(\"Files.isReadable(path) = \" + Files.isReadable(path));\nSystem.out.println(\"Files.isDirectory(path) = \" + Files.isDirectory(path));\ntry {\n    Path copy = Paths.get(\"/Users/michiel/Desktop/test.fa\");\n    //delete if it already exists\n    Files.deleteIfExists(copy);\n    Files.copy(path, copy);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\noutputs this, and copies the file to my Desktop.\nFiles.isReadable(path) = true\nFiles.isDirectory(path) = false\nFiles.copy() = /Users/michiel/Desktop/test.fa\nClass File represents the actual file on the storage system.

Besides APPEND you have these choices:\n\nAPPEND If the file is opened for WRITE access then bytes will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning.\nCREATE Create a new file if it does not exist.\nCREATE_NEW Create a new file, failing if the file already exists.\nREAD Open for read access.\nWRITE Open for write access.\n\nRunning this code twice will generate this file contents:\n\nFor convenience, you can wrap the BufferedWriter into a PrintWriter instance. This gives you easier line writing and the possibility for string formatting:\ntry (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(Files.newBufferedWriter(dataPath, StandardOpenOption.APPEND))) {\n    writer.println(\"I'm back!\");\n    writer.format(\"%s is mijn voornaam en %s mijn achternaam\", \"Michiel\", \"Noback\");\n    //Also nice:  class MessageFormat\n    writer.println(MessageFormat.format(\"{0} is mijn voornaam en {1} mijn achternaam\", \"Jan\", \"Jansen\"));\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nRead\nReading data from file is a similar process:\ntry(BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(dataPath)) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(\"line = \" + line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nParsing file content the easy way\nA thing that typically happens when reading data is to split the line into elements on some separator:\n//splits on spaces\nString[] elements = line.split(\" \")\n\nIn this example, this is the employee data we are going to process. \n\nName    Age    Function    Salary*1000\nJohnDoe    27    Programmer    23.67\nJaneSmith    31    Manager    42.00\nJoanDonnely    38    CEO    89.87\nRoseBanner    18    secretary    11.78\n\n\nFile empl_data.csv is a tab-separated file. Note the first line is a header and not real data.\nHere is a typical use case for working with structured data. First, class Employee:\npackage snippets.apis;\n\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private double salary;\n\n    public Employee(String name, int age, double salary) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee{\" +\n                \"name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n                \", age=\" + age +\n                \", salary=\" + salary +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n\nNext, parse Employee instances:\nprivate static List parseEmployees() {\n    String fileName = \"/Users/michiel/IdeaProjects/JavaIntroProgrammingAssignments/data/empl_data.csv\";\n    Path path = Paths.get(fileName);\n    List employees = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {\n        String line;\n        int lineNumber = 0;\n\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lineNumber++;\n            //skips first header line\n            if (lineNumber == 1) continue;\n            //split on tabs\n            String[] elements = line.split(\"\\t\");\n            String name = elements[0];\n            //convert to int\n            int age = Integer.parseInt(elements[1]);\n            String function = elements[2];\n            //convert to double\n            double salary = Double.parseDouble(elements[3]) * 1000;\n\n            Employee emp = new Employee(name, age, salary);\n            employees.add(emp);\n            System.out.println(emp);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return employees;\n}\n\nAs stated before: this is very typical for the start of any data processing pipeline.\nMore advanced splitting is discussed in a next topic: regular expressions.\nNote on character sets\nAll these examples worked with the default characterset of Java, UTF-8. When other sets are required, these can be specified in the Files.newBufferedReader() and Files.newBufferedWriter() factory methods. See docs for details.\n"},"03_apis/regex.html":{"url":"03_apis/regex.html","title":"Regular Expressions","keywords":"","body":"Regular Expressions\nOften, when your data is well-structured, a String.split() with a simple separator is all you need to process your data,maybe with some conversion methods for creating ints and doubles and such from strings. However, there are cases when you need more: finding restriction enzyme sites, parsing zip codes in addresses for instance.\nThis part only introduces the Java regex API\nIt is NOT a tutorial on regex!\n(PS, I borrowed some examples from http://www.vogella.com)\nRegular expressions are used to search for patterns in text\nFor instance, if you want to find occurrences of Dutch zip codes, you could use this: [a-zA-Z]{4} ?[0-9]{2}\nFor Java regex, these classes are related to regular expression matching (and replacement):  \n\njava.lang.String has several useful methods working with regexes\njava.util.regex.Pattern works together with java.util.regex.Matcher for advanced regex operations\n\nWhat is a regex?\nA regular expression is used to describe a pattern that is not literal - different distinct character strings could match the pattern. \nBackslashes\nBackslashes have meanings both in String literals and in regex. They denote special characters, but also negate the special meaning\nThus, to match a literal backslash, your regex will be \\\\\\\\ !! \nCharacter classes\nYou can specify groups of characters that are all equally valid to match a position using character classes. They can be specified in many ways.\n\n\n\nCharacter class\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n.\nAny character\n\n\n[]\nSet definition, eg [a-z] matches all lowercase characters;  [aAbB1234] matches an a, A, b, B or numbers 1, 2 ,3, 4\n\n\n[^]\nNegated set definition, eg [^a-z] matches anything BUT lowercase characters\n\n\nX|Z\nMatches X or Z (either one will suffice)\n\n\n^regex\nAnchors regex at beginning of line\n\n\nregex$\nAnchors regex at end of line\n\n\n\\d \\D\nAny digit, [0-9];  any non-digit, [^0-9]\n\n\n\\s \\S\nAny whitespace character;  any non-whitespace character\n\n\n\\w \\W\nA word character, short for [a-zA-Z_0-9];  same but negated\n\n\n\\b\nWord boundary\n\n\n\nRegex quantifiers\nQuantifiers let you modify how often a group or character is allowed.\n\n\n\nQuantifier\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n{x}\nOccurs exactly x times\n\n\n{x, }\nOccurs at least x times\n\n\n{, x}\nOccurs at the most x times\n\n\n*\nOccurs zero or more times; same as {0, }\n\n\n+\nOccurs one or more times; same as {1, }\n\n\n?\nOccurs zero or one time; same as {0, 1}\n\n\n*?\nNon-greedy: \"?\" after a quantifier makes it a reluctant quantifier, it tries to find the smallest match\n\n\n\nGrouping and backreferencing\nUsing parentheses, you can group parts of your regex. \nThey can be used to\n\nRetrieve or substitute parts of a regex\nApply quantifiers to groups\nuse back referencing\n\nVia the $ you can refer to a group. $1 is the first group, $2 the second, etc (see examples).\nSimilarly, back referencing is used to repeat pattern matches; this will replace all repeating character patterns:\n\"ABCDEEEFGGHIJJJKL\".replaceAll(\"(\\\\w)\\\\1+\", \"_rep_\")\n\nresulting in ABCD_rep_F_rep_HI_rep_KL.\nMethods of class String\nMany of the common tasks can be performed using the String class only. \n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ns.matches(regex)\nTells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression.\n\n\ns.split(regex)\nSplits this string around matches of the given regular expression\n\n\ns.split(regex, limit)\nIdem, but the limit parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied\n\n\ns.replaceAll(regex, replacement)\nReplaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement\n\n\ns.replaceFirst(regex, replacement)\nReplaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.\n\n\n\nHere are some examples.\nString input = \"Dogs rule this doggin' world\";\n//replace() works with literal string!\nSystem.out.println(input.replace(\"[Dd]og\", \"Cat\"));\nSystem.out.println(input.replace(\"Dog\", \"Cat\"));\n//replaceAll() works with regex!\nSystem.out.println(input.replaceAll(\"[Dd]og\", \"Cat\"));\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(input.split(\"[Dd]\")));\n//matches() looks at whole target string.\nSystem.out.println(input.matches(\"[Dd]ogs\"));\nSystem.out.println(input.matches(\"^[Dd]ogs.+\"));\n\noutputs \n\nDogs rule this doggin' world\nCats rule this doggin' world\nCats rule this Catgin' world\n[, ogs rule this , oggin' worl]\nfalse\ntrue\n\n\nSome more advanced examples:\nString INPUT = \"This is the example \" \n    + \"string which , I'm going to use for pattern matching.\";\n\n// Split on whitespace stretches\nString[] splitString = (INPUT.split(\"\\\\s+\"));\n\n// Removes whitespace between a word character and . or ,\nString pattern = \"(\\\\w)(\\\\s+)([\\\\.,])\";\nSystem.out.println(INPUT.replaceAll(pattern, \"$1$3\")); \n\n// Extract the text between the two title elements of\npattern = \"(?i)()(.+?)()\";\nString updated = INPUT.replaceAll(pattern, \"$2\"); \n\n// prints true if the string contains a number less then 300\nSystem.out.println(s.matches(\"[^0-9]*[12]?[0-9]{1,2}[^0-9]*\"));\n\nNote that adjusting the regex mode with (?i) makes the regex case insensitive. \nPattern & Matcher\nFor more complex tasks, use class Pattern to specify it and class Matcher to find, replace or extract it.\nHere is a typical use case:\n        //with case insensitive matching\n        Pattern hinc2 = Pattern.compile(\"(?i)(GT([CT][AG])AC)\");\n        Matcher matcher = hinc2.matcher(\"GTCAACtgttgaccc\");\n\n        while (matcher.find()) {\n            System.out.println(\"matcher.group() = \" + matcher.group());\n            //whole pattern - same as group()\n            System.out.println(\"matcher.group(0) = \" + matcher.group(0));\n            System.out.println(\"matcher.group(2) = \" + matcher.group(2));\n            System.out.println(\"matcher.start() = \" + matcher.start());\n        }\n\n        //with chained method calls - replace with group capture\n        final String replaced = hinc2.matcher(\"GTCAACtgttgaccc\").replaceAll(\"[[$1]]\");\n        System.out.println(\"replaced = \" + replaced);\n\noutputs\n\nmatcher.group() = GTCAAC\nmatcher.group(0) = GTCAAC\nmatcher.group(2) = CA\nmatcher.start() = 0\nmatcher.group() = gttgac\nmatcher.group(0) = gttgac\nmatcher.group(2) = tg\nmatcher.start() = 7\nreplaced = [[GTCAAC]]t[[gttgac]]cc\n\n\nNote: when a Pattern object is used more than once, a compiled version should be cashed! Usually this is done in an instance or class variable.\nThere is much more to regex of course; GIYF for more detailed use cases.\n"},"04_oop/class_design.html":{"url":"04_oop/class_design.html","title":"Encapsulation through access modifiers","keywords":"","body":"Encapsulation through access modifiers\nSo far, we have not dealt with the concept of data hiding which actually is a pivotal aspect of object-oriented programming. This concept will be illustrated here, starting with the Cell class from Part one (see A first look at objects). I modified it a bit for demonstration purposes. All access modifiers were removed and a check was introduced, so that the program crashes when a Cell grows too big.\npackage snippets.testtube2;\n\npublic class Cell {\n    //diameter in micrometers\n    int diameter = 5;\n    int growthIncrement = 1;\n\n    /**\n     * Lets this cell grow in a single increment\n     */\n    void grow() {\n        //grow by 1 micrometer\n        this.diameter += growthIncrement;\n        //we can grow many cycles safely before resources run out\n        if (this.diameter > 1000) throw new Error(\"TestTube will explode in 5 seconds\");\n    }\n}\n\nSo, the logic of this cell is based on the assumption that it starts growing at size 5 with an increment of 1 at each cycle. Nothing funny going on.\nNow here is a very simple version of class TestTube.\npackage snippets.testtube2;\n\nclass TestTube {\n    Cell cell;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        TestTube tube = new TestTube();\n        tube.cell = new Cell();\n        //run for 5 generations\n        for (int i = 0; i \nwhich outputs \n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.Error: TestTube will explode in 5 seconds\n    at snippets.testtube2.Cell.grow(Cell.java:14)\n    at snippets.testtube2.TestTube.growCells(TestTube.java:22)\n    at snippets.testtube2.TestTube.main(TestTube.java:11)\n\n\nThe TestTube developer was working with nanometer units while the Cell developer was working with micrometer units. The result is a crashing application (or Mars orbiter). \nBesides this big problem, when another class tries to run the growCells() method on a TestTube instance, it will get a NullPointerException. Can you figure out why?\nSo we need a way to protect the inner state of objects\nJava has a heap of techniques for preventing illegal access or modification to your instance variables (and methods). These techniques start with the use of access modifiers.\nLet's improve and secure this Cell and TesTube and keep access open only to that which needs to be publicly accessible.\nHere is a new and improved Cell class:\npackage snippets.testtube2;\n\npublic class Cell {\n    private int diameterInMicrometers = 5;\n    private final int growthIncrementInMicrometers;\n\n    /**\n     * Construct with diameter and growth increment, in micrometers.\n     *\n     * @param diameterInMicrometers diameter between 1 and 40 micrometers\n     * @param growthIncrementInMicrometers growth increment between 1 and 5 micrometers\n     * @throws IllegalArgumentException ex if one of the arguments is out of range\n     */\n     public Cell(int diameterInMicrometers, int growthIncrementInMicrometers) {\n        if (diameterInMicrometers  41\n            || growthIncrementInMicrometers  6\n        ) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cell size must start between 0 and 40 \" +\n                    \"and growth increment between 0 and 5\");\n        }\n        this.diameterInMicrometers = diameterInMicrometers;\n        //growth increment can never be changed after construction\n        this.growthIncrementInMicrometers = growthIncrementInMicrometers;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Serves the read-only property diameter.\n     * @return\n     */\n    public int getDiameterInMicrometers() {\n        return diameterInMicrometers;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Grows this cell in a single increment, increasing its size with one time\n     * the growth increment.\n     * \n     */\n    public void grow() {\n        this.diameterInMicrometers += growthIncrementInMicrometers;\n        if (this.diameterInMicrometers > 1000) throw new Error(\"TestTube will explode in 5 seconds\");\n    }\n}\n\nQuite a lot has changed:\n\nAll instance variables have been marked private which means only code inside class Cell can access them. \nVariables have been renamed to be more reflective of what they represent.\nA Constructor was added to provide a single point of assignment to both variables, at construction time. \nThe constructor performs a check on its parameters so that illegal arguments are caught early.\nJavadoc was added to explain the public API.\nA single getter was introduced for property diameter, making it a read-only property. \nNo getter was created for property growthIncrementInMicrometers because it was decided by the developer (me) that it should only be set once during the life cycle of a Cell object. For that reason, instance variable growthIncrementInMicrometers was marked final.\n\nOne setback of this whole procedure: class TestTube will not compile anymore because (a) it attempts to access the private members of class Cell and (b) because there is no no-arg constructor anymore:\n\nSince Javadoc was added to class Cell, we can get additional information in IntelliJ by pressing ctrl + Q (Linux), ctrl + J (Mac), or F1when the cursor is on the Constructor:\n\nLet's solve the compilation problems, make TestTube safe, add multi-cell support, and move the main() function to the Simulator class.\npackage snippets.testtube2;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class TestTube {\n    private final int numberOfLifeCyclesToRun;\n    private final int initialCellCount;\n    private List cells = new ArrayList<>();\n    private int defaultCellDiameter = 20;\n    private int defaultSizeIncrement = 2;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructs with the two essential parameters\n     * @param numberOfLifeCyclesToRun a number between 1 and 100\n     * @param initialCellCount a number between 1 and 1000\n     * @return testtube a TestTube instance\n     */\n    public TestTube (int numberOfLifeCyclesToRun, int initialCellCount) {\n        if (numberOfLifeCyclesToRun  100\n                || initialCellCount  1000) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Number of life cycles should be between 1 and 100 and initial cell \" +\n                    \"count between 1 and 1000\");\n        }\n        this.numberOfLifeCyclesToRun = numberOfLifeCyclesToRun;\n        this.initialCellCount = initialCellCount;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * sets the initial diameter of instantiated cells.\n     * @param defaultCellDiameter\n     */\n    public void setDefaultCellDiameter(int defaultCellDiameter) {\n        this.defaultCellDiameter = defaultCellDiameter;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Sets the size increment for cell growth\n     * @param defaultSizeIncrement\n     */\n    public void setDefaultSizeIncrement(int defaultSizeIncrement) {\n        this.defaultSizeIncrement = defaultSizeIncrement;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * starts the growth process\n     */\n    public void start() {\n        initializeCells();\n        runLifeCycles();\n    }\n\n    private void runLifeCycles() {\n        for (int i = 0; i  c.grow());\n        //or\n        //this.cells.forEach(Cell::grow);\n    }\n}\n\nYes, the class file became substantially larger - one of the setbacks of safe design.\nThere are several noteworthy changes here:\n\nAll instance variables are private. Note a pattern here?\nTwo public setters were provided (making defaultCellDiameter and  defaultSizeIncrement write-only), a public constructor and one public API method that will start the testtube: start()\nAll functionality is divided into very small methods with a very clear (and testable) responsibility. This is the Single responsibility Principle at work. See post SRP for more details.\n\nFinally, here is the controller class CellGrowthSimulator. Its sole purpose is now to start the simulation process.\npackage snippets.testtube2;\n\n/**\n * \"Controller\" class\n */\npublic class CellGrowthSimulator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        startSimulation();\n    }\n\n    private static void startSimulation() {\n        TestTube testTube = new TestTube(10, 5);\n        testTube.setDefaultCellDiameter(10);\n        testTube.start();\n    }\n}\n\nSummary\nThis post has introduced a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming and design: encapsulation; hiding the inner workings of a class, mostly through the use of the private keyword and usage of getters and setters. It has also shown a first view of abstraction in class TestTube: this class has a single simple public API method (start()) and has hidden all the complexities of its simulation algorithm. \nYou have seen two access modifiers; there are two more that are dealt with in the next post.\nAlso, there is another post covering some more sophisticated aspects of encapsulation.\n"},"04_oop/access_modifiers.html":{"url":"04_oop/access_modifiers.html","title":"Access modifiers & other keywords","keywords":"","body":"Access modifiers & Other keywords\nSeveral access modifiers and keywords have already been introduced, explicitly or implicitly. This post gives an overview of the most important ones.\nAccess Modifiers\nAccess modifiers are used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class -collectively called members- to control access to them.\nUsing no modifier is an (implicit) modifier, giving default - but very distinct! - behavior.\n\nprivate\n  Private members can only be accessed by other members of their own class.\n\nprotected\n  Protected members can only be accessed by members of their own class, that class's subclasses or classes from the same package.\n\npublic\n  Public members can be accessed by the members of any class.\n\ndefault access occurs when no explicit access modifier is attached to a member. Members with default access can be accessed by classes within the same package.\n\n\nThis is the same info in table form:\n\n\n\nKeyword\nClass\nPackage\nSubclass\nAll\n\n\n\n\npublic\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nprotected\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\n\ndefault/no modifier\n✓\n✓\n\n\n\n\nprivate\n✓\n\n\n\n\n\nCareful choice of access levels is fundamental to good Java design. Although there are no strict rules, fields (instance and class variables) should usually be private, where public (or default) getters and/or setters privide read and/or write access. API methods should be public. When classes in the same package work intimately together, default access can be appropriate. The same holds for inheritance relationships and the protected modifier. \nDesign rule: Minimize the accessibility of class members.\nChanging public API methods is almost impossible since it will create backward incompatibility.\nKeywords\nThis is a list of keywords in the Java programming language. I omitted the access modifiers (discussed separately), the primitive types, flow control keywords as well as some I do not deem essential in an introduction of Java. You cannot use any of the these as identifiers. Text was copied from Wikipedia and edited. \n\nabstract\n  Abstracts are used to implement an abstraction in Java. A method with no definition must be declared as abstract and the class containing it must be declared as abstract. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. Abstract methods must be implemented in the first concrete subclass. Note that an abstract class isn't required to have an abstract method at all.\n\nassert (added in J2SE 1.4)\n  Assert describes a predicate (a true–false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort. \n\nclass\n  A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition specifies the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass is implicitly Object. The class keyword can also be used in the form Class.class to get a Class object without needing an instance of that class. For example, String.class can be used instead of doing new String().getClass().\n\nenum (added in J2SE 5.0)[3]\n  A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class Enum.\n\nextends\n  Used in a class declaration to specify the superclass; used in an interface declaration to specify one or more superinterfaces. Class X extends class Y to add functionality, either by adding fields or methods to class Y, or by overriding methods of class Y. An interface Z extends one or more interfaces by adding methods. Class X is said to be a subclass of class Y; Interface Z is said to be a subinterface of the interfaces it extends.\n  Also used to specify an upper bound on a type parameter in Generics.\n\nfinal\n  Define an entity once that cannot be changed nor derived from later. More specifically: a final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable can occur at most once as a left-hand expression on an executed command. All methods in a final class are implicitly final.\n\nimplements\n  Included in a class declaration to specify one or more interfaces that are implemented by the current class. A class inherits the types and abstract methods declared by the interfaces.\n\nimport\n  Used at the beginning of a source file to specify classes or entire Java packages to be referred to later without including their package names in the reference. Since J2SE 5.0, import statements can import static members of a class.\n\ninterface\n  Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract or default methods, constant (static final) fields and static interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the implements keyword. \n\nnew\n  Used to create an instance of a class or array object.\n\npackage\n  A Java package is a group of similar classes and interfaces. Packages are declared with the package keyword. Classes have a package declaration at the top of the source file.\n\nstatic\n  Used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field. Classes maintain one copy of class fields regardless of how many instances exist of that class. static also is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are bound to the class instead of a specific instance, and can only operate on class fields. (Classes and interfaces declared as static members of another class or interface are actually top-level classes and are not inner classes.)\n\nsuper\n  Used to access members of a class inherited by the class in which it appears. Allows a subclass to access overridden methods and hidden members of its superclass. The super keyword is also used to forward a call from a constructor to a constructor in the superclass.\n  Also used to specify a lower bound on a type parameter in Generics.\n\nthis\n  Used to represent an instance of the class in which it appears. this can be used to access class members and as a reference to the current instance. The this keyword is also used to forward a call from one constructor in a class to another constructor in the same class.\n\nthrow\n  Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue with the first enclosing exception handler declared by the catch keyword to handle an assignment compatible exception type. If no such exception handler is found in the current method, then the method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no exception handler is found in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread's uncaught exception handler.\n\nthrows\n  Used in method declarations to specify which exceptions are not handled within the method but rather passed to the next higher level of the program. All uncaught exceptions in a method that are not instances of RuntimeException must be declared using the throws keyword.\n\nvoid\n  The void keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value.\n\n\n"},"04_oop/inheritance.html":{"url":"04_oop/inheritance.html","title":"Inheritance and UML","keywords":"","body":"Inheritance and UML\nIn this post, the concept of inheritance will be revisited and expanded. Since this is a good place for it, a visualization standard called UML (Unified Modelling Language) is also introduced.\nThe TestTube with cells\nHere is the TestTube at the end of the post Encapsulation through access modifiers. Instead of showing code, a UML diagram is displayed.\n\nYou can generate such a thing yourself in IntelliJ by selecting the source files you want to visualize -> right-click -> Diagrams -> Show Diagram.\nThe diagram above shows everything: fields, methods, constructors, with any access level. Using the Diagrams menu (and general settings - see the doc) you can filter what you want to show. Here are the same classes with only the public fields shown, and no constructors:\n\nSo, what does this tell us? Class CellGrowthSimulator has a singular field of type TestTube and creates the instance itself. Class TestTube has 1 to many instances of Cell (held in a List), and instantiates them itself. These HAS_A relations (class A has an instance of class B) are depicted with the arrow-with-diamond connector.\nNew specs: different types of cells\nSo here comes your boss and tells you  \n\"...but how about het difference between bacteria and eukaryotic cells??\nThey are of way different size and grow at different speeds.I WANT TO GROW MANY TYPES OF CELLS IN MY TEST TUBE!!And didn't I tell you? They should be able to divide as well.\"\nYou start thinking about the new specs. \n\nWhen to divide? \nWho controls division: \nTestTube or the cell itself? \n\n\nHow does this relate to growing?\nThe different cell types is easy! Just give every type its own class\n\nAs an expert on the subject, you decide that the cells and not the test tube should know when to divide; in fact, they should be solely responsible for their size and increment (not the testtube). Division is depending on the cell size: when a certain size is reached, it is time to divide.\nHere is the new design. Note that I simplified the names again and removed comments for conciseness' sake.\nclass Bacterium\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\npublic class Bacterium {\n    private int diameter = 10;\n    private static final int growthIncrement = 1;\n    private static final int maximumDiameter = 30;\n\n    public int getDiameter() {\n        return diameter;\n    }\n\n    public Bacterium grow() {\n        this.diameter += growthIncrement;\n        if (this.diameter > maximumDiameter) {\n            return new Bacterium();\n        } else {\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Eukaryote\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\npublic class Eukaryote {\n    private int diameter = 20;\n    private static final int growthIncrement = 3;\n    private static final int maximumDiameter = 80;\n\n    public int getDiameter() {\n        return diameter;\n    }\n\n    public Eukaryote grow() {\n        this.diameter += growthIncrement;\n        if (this.diameter > maximumDiameter) {\n            return new Eukaryote();\n        } else {\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSee how similar it is to class Bacterium?\nclass TestTube\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class TestTube {\n    private final int numberOfLifeCyclesToRun;\n    private final int initialCellCount;\n    private final String cellType;\n    private List bacteria = new ArrayList<>();\n    private List eukaryotes = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public TestTube (int numberOfLifeCyclesToRun, int initialCellCount, String cellType) {\n        //check code omitted\n        this.numberOfLifeCyclesToRun = numberOfLifeCyclesToRun;\n        this.initialCellCount = initialCellCount;\n        this.cellType = cellType;\n    }\n\n    public void start() {\n        initializeCells();\n        runLifeCycles();\n    }\n\n    private void runLifeCycles() {\n        for (int i = 0; i \nSee how much duplicated code there is in class TestTube, and repeated use of same if/else blocks? \nHere is the UML of this situation (private fields included). It shows the duplication clearly as well.\n\nRepeated code and similar if/else algorithm logic are typical signs of smelly code that can be solved using some Object Oriented design techniques, in this case inheritance.\nApply inheritance to model what is common\nInheritance can be used when there is a IS-A relationship: when it can be said that class A IS-A class B. For example, Apple IS-A Fruit and Pear IS-A Fruit (but not Pear IS-A Apple!). In this case, the IS-A relation ship can be defined as \"Bacterium IS-A Cell\" and \"Eukaryote IS-A Cell\".\nOnce this prerequisite for inheritance is established, the common superclass should be created and all common code from the subclasses moved to it.\nClass Cell can clearly hold the diameter, the growthIncrement and the maximumDiameter fields, even though they will be different between the subclasses. Class Cell can also publish the growCells() method, even though they will be implemented differently in the subclasses. Key here is that all subclasses will be able to grow. When you know the functionality should be there, but don't know how, your should make it abstract. As a consequence, your class needs to be abstract as well. Let's review this with class Cell.\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\npublic abstract class Cell {\n    //no decent defaults possible at level of class Cell,\n    //but we know this field is relevant\n    private int diameter;\n\n    public Cell(int initialDiameter) {\n        this.diameter = initialDiameter;\n    }\n\n    public int getDiameter() {\n        return diameter;\n    }\n\n    protected void setDiameter(int newDiameter) {\n        this.diameter = newDiameter;\n    }\n\n    public abstract Cell grow();\n}\n\nNote that both the class declaration and the method grow() have been marked abstract. An abstract method has no method body, only a signature - the same as with interfaces. An abstract class cannot be instantiated.. This snippet Cell cell = new Cell(12) will not compile.\nThe next step is declaring your subclasses to extend the superclass (only Bacterium shown here):\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\npublic class Bacterium extends Cell{\n    private static int bacterialInitialDiameter = 10;\n    private static final int growthIncrement = 1;\n    private static final int maximumDiameter = 30;\n\n    public Bacterium() {\n        super(bacterialInitialDiameter);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Cell grow() {\n        setDiameter(getDiameter() + growthIncrement);\n        if (getDiameter() > maximumDiameter) {\n            return new Bacterium();\n        } else {\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nClass Bacterium is required to implement a constructor serving an initial size to the class Cell constructor. It has no diameter property anymore, and no getter for it. It has implemented the grow() method, and because of that is is not abstract and can be instantiated. Note that, although the  method signature is public Cell grow(), it returns a Bacterium instance. This is a typical example of polymorphism.\nYou may notice that the static variables growthIncrement and maximumDiameter will be specified in all subclasses and could be specified once (in class Cell). This is true, and several solutions exist for static fields, but focus here lies on different aspects.\nYou may also notice there is not much won with respect to amount of code. That is correct, but in this case the improvement lies in class TestTube:\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class TestTube {\n    private final int numberOfLifeCyclesToRun;\n    private final int initialCellCount;\n    private final String cellType;\n    private List cells = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    /**\n     * Constructs with the two essential parameters\n     * @param numberOfLifeCyclesToRun a number between 1 and 100\n     * @param initialCellCount a number between 1 and 1000\n     * @param cellType the cell type [\"\n     * @return testtube a TestTube instance\n     */\n    public TestTube (int numberOfLifeCyclesToRun, int initialCellCount, String cellType) {\n        //check code omitted\n        this.numberOfLifeCyclesToRun = numberOfLifeCyclesToRun;\n        this.initialCellCount = initialCellCount;\n        this.cellType = cellType;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * starts the growth process\n     */\n    public void start() {\n        initializeCells();\n        runLifeCycles();\n    }\n\n    private void runLifeCycles() {\n        for (int i = 1; i \nYou can see the cell growing logic has been completely decoupled from the actual cells that are being grown. Both grow() methods in the subclasses have specific signatures with respect to the return type (Bacterium, Eukaryote), but still adhere to the superclass contract (otherwise @Override would have instigated a compiler error).\nFor completeness, here is the simulator class, and some output:\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\npublic class CellGrowthSimulator {\n    private static TestTube testTube;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        startSimulation();\n    }\n\n    private static void startSimulation() {\n        testTube = new TestTube(100,5, \"Bacteria\");\n        testTube.start();\n    }\n}\n\noutputs\n\nGrow cycle 10 finished; 5 cells present\nGrow cycle 20 finished; 5 cells present\nGrow cycle 30 finished; 55 cells present\nGrow cycle 40 finished; 105 cells present\nGrow cycle 50 finished; 430 cells present\nGrow cycle 60 finished; 1255 cells present\nGrow cycle 70 finished; 3680 cells present\nGrow cycle 80 finished; 12105 cells present\nGrow cycle 90 finished; 35105 cells present\nGrow cycle 100 finished; 111230 cells present\n\n\nFinally, there is some logic that should be moved for good design. The Cell creation logic should be put in a  static factory method inside class Cell to abstract away the cell creation logic and put it in one place for the entire application:\npublic static Cell of(String type) {\n    switch (type) {\n        case \"Bacteria\": return new Bacterium();\n        case \"Eukarya\": return new Eukaryote();\n        default: throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown cell type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n\nand class `TestTube becomes even less aware of whet is being grown:\nprivate void initializeCells() {\n    for (int i = 0; i \nHere is the final UML. \n\nThis also shows that actual cell types are hidden behind the abstract Cell class. The subtype constructors could even have been marked protected or  to emphasize this.\nThis is the power of polymorphism implemented with inheritance!\nPolymorphism allows one type to express some sort of contract, and for other types to implement that contract (often through class inheritance) in different ways. Code using that contract should not have to care about which implementation is involved, only that the contract is obeyed.\nUse a type cast when you need the specific type\nYou have seen it is often best to code against generic types, like in this block:\n    private void growCells() {\n        for (int i = 0; i \nBut what if you have the need for specific functionality? For instance, you have a WhiteBloodCell which can also eatOtherCell(Cell cell):\npackage snippets.testtube3;\n\npublic class WhiteBloodCell extends Eukaryote {\n    public WhiteBloodCell() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    public void eatOtherCell(Cell cell) {\n        System.out.println(\"White blood cell, eating other cell\");\n        //cell eating logic\n    }\n}\n\nNote that this class extends Eukaryote and thereby inherits the grow() method. Now if you want to do something specifically white-blood-cellish, perform a type-test-and-cast:\n    private void growCells() {\n        for (int i = 0; i \nThe lesson here: Objects never ever change type, only the reference to them changes.\n"},"04_oop/enums.html":{"url":"04_oop/enums.html","title":"Enums","keywords":"","body":"Enums: constants on steroids\nConstants are everywhere\nConstants are everywhere: the number pi, the number e, the URL to a web service \nyou use in your app. These are really simple constants that do not need anything \nspecial besides being defined as a  \npublic static final String PI = 3.1416;\npublic static final String API_URL = \"http://www.example.com\";\n\nOf course, any alert observer might state that pi is already defined in class \nMath as PI, and in much more detail: 3.141592653589793.

I will \nshow you that Java enums are so much more than simple constants. In fact, enums \nare regular Java classes, but only special in the fact that only the instances \ndefined in the enum class file will ever see the day of light!  \nFor instance, the roles of visitors in your web application: GUEST, LOGGED_IN_USER, \nADMIN, or pizza sizes in your online ordering form: SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, \nLUNATIC. Or the four letters of the DNA alphabet: G, A, T and C. Let’s look at an example using the nucleotides.  \npublic enum Nucleotide {\n    A,\n    C, \n    G,\n    T;\n}\n\nHere, I have defined an enum with four values: G, A, T, and C. As a convention, enum value names must always be all-caps.You can do some nice things with it already.  \npackage enums;\n\npublic final class EnumDemo {\n    public static void main(final String[] args) {\n        EnumDemo enumDemo = new EnumDemo();\n        enumDemo.start();\n    }\n\n    private void start() {\n        Nucleotide nucA = Nucleotide.A;\n        //print it\n        System.out.println(\"nucA = \" + nucA);\n        //test its nature\n        if (nucA == Nucleotide.A) {\n            System.out.println(\"We've got an A!\");\n        }\n        //switch on it!\n        switchOnNucleotide(Nucleotide.G);\n    }\n\n    private void switchOnNucleotide(final Nucleotide nuc) {\n        switch (nuc) {\n            case A:\n                System.out.println(\"It is an A\");\n                break;\n            case C:\n                System.out.println(\"It is a C\");\n                break;\n            case G:\n                System.out.println(\"It is a G\");\n                break;\n            case T:\n                System.out.println(\"It is a T\");\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen printed, an enum will simply be displayed as the name of its value:  \n\nnucA = A\nWe've got an A!\nIt is an G\n\n\nIf you want something else printed by default besides the name of the constant, \nyou can provide this value through a constructor:  \npackage enums;\n\npublic enum Nucleotide {\n    A(\"Adenine\"),\n    C(\"Guanine\"),\n    G(\"Cytosine\"),\n    T(\"Thymine\");\n\n    private String name;\n\n    private Nucleotide(final String fullName) {\n        this.name = fullName;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\nNow, when you print an enum you will get its string value given via the constructor \nargument. Yes, this A(\"Adenine\") constructs a Nucleotide enum constant of type Nucleotide.A with \"name\" property \"Adenine\". \nThe reverse is also a much-used aspect: you have some string value and want to create an enum from it.This is how it's done:  \nString letter = \"G\";\nNucleotide nuc = Nucleotide.valueOf(letter);\nSystem.out.println(\"nuc = \" + nuc);\n\nThis will output  \n\nnuc = Guanine\n\n\nThis valueOf() call returned the Nucleotide.G constant. Note it will not be created, since only one instance will exist during your app life cycle.\nWhen you use a non-existing value you get an IllegalArgumentException:\nletter = \"P\";\nnuc = Nucleotide.valueOf(letter);\n\nThis will output  \n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant enums.Nucleotide.P\n    at java.lang.Enum.valueOf(Enum.java:238)\n    at enums.Nucleotide.valueOf(Nucleotide.java:11)\n    at enums.EnumDemo.start(EnumDemo.java:41)\n    at enums.EnumDemo.main(EnumDemo.java:19)\n\n\nThis is already pretty neat, yes? And we're only just getting started!  \nLet's add some functionality. First something simple: provide access to the \nnucleotides’ molecular weight. I’ll use a HashMap to store these values and \ndefine a simple method that serves them.\n    //rest of class omitted\n\n    private static final HashMap MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS;\n    /**\n     * static initializer to populate the map.\n     */\n    static {\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS = new HashMap<>();\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(A, 313.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(C, 304.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(G, 329.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(T, 304.2);\n    }\n    /**\n     * returns the molecular weight of this nucleotide in single-stranded DNA, in Daltons.\n     * @return molecularWeight\n     */\n    public double getMolecularWeight() {\n        return MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.get(this);\n    }\n    //rest of class omitted\n\nSee how you can use the reference to this to fetch the molecular weight? \nHere are two lines using this functionality:\nSystem.out.println(\"nuc A weight = \" + nucA.getMolecularWeight());\nSystem.out.println(\"nuc C weight = \" + Nucleotide.C.getMolecularWeight());\n\nBut how about the complements of these values (you know, the letter on the other \nstrand of DNA in the double helix, the one it pairs with)? “A” has as complement \n“T”, “G” has “C” etc. I want to be able to get a complement for all nucleotides, \ngiven its original value. Exactly the same as the molecular weights, but the \nvalue is another nucleotide.  \nStill this is not the whole story. The piece de resistance has yet to come. As \nyou may know, there is another nucleotide that does not occur in DNA but solely \nin RNA: U (Uracil). DNA has A, C, G and T while RNA has A, C, G, and U. Thus, U \nreplaces T in RNA. I want to add that one to my Nucleotide enum, and also provide \na method that will tell me whether a nucleotide only occurs in RNA. I could \nsimply provide a map for that, but this is not as efficient (or cool) as \nanother solution. In fact, ONLY the U is exclusive for RNA. Therefore, I could \nprovide some default functionality and override that behavior for Uracil. \n    //rest of enum omitted\n    A(\"Adenine\"),\n    C(\"Guanine\"),\n    G(\"Cytosine\"),\n    T(\"Thymine\"),\n    U(\"Uracil\") {\n        /*yes! a CONSTANT-SPECIFIC CLASS BODY!*/\n        @Override\n        public boolean isExclusiveRNA() {\n            //override for single RNA nucleotide\n            return true;\n        }\n    };\n    //rest of enum omitted\n    /**\n     * returns whether this nucleotide is only found in RNA.\n     *\n     * @return isExclusiveRNA\n     */\n    public boolean isExclusiveRNA() {\n        //the default value\n        return false;\n    }\n    //rest of enum omitted\n\nThis is an example of a constant-specific class body, something only certified \nJava programmers seem to know about. And now you do, too. Its purpose is to \nprovide an override for some generic functionality that applies to most of the \nother constants of the enum.\nBelow follows the complete code of the enum. Of course, there is at least one \nmajor flaw in the model with respect to adherence to molecular biology – there \nawaits eternal fame for you if you find it.\npackage enums;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\n\npublic enum Nucleotide {\n    A(\"Adenine\"),\n    C(\"Guanine\"),\n    G(\"Cytosine\"),\n    T(\"Thymine\"),\n    U(\"Uracil\") {\n        /*yes! a CONSTANT-SPECIFIC CLASS BODY!*/\n        @Override\n        public boolean isExclusiveRNA() {\n            return true;\n        }\n    };\n    private static final HashMap MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS;\n    private static final HashMap REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS;\n\n    static {\n        //MOL WEIGHTS\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS = new HashMap<>();\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(A, 331.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(C, 307.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(G, 347.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(T, 322.2);\n        MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.put(T, 324.2);\n        //REV COMPLS\n        REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS = new HashMap<>();\n        REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS.put(A, T);\n        REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS.put(C, G);\n        REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS.put(G, C);\n        REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS.put(T, A);\n        REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS.put(U, A);\n    }\n\n    public double getMolecularWeight() {\n        return MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS.get(this);\n    }\n\n    public Nucleotide complement() {\n        return REVERSE_COMPLEMENTS.get(this);\n    }\n\n    public boolean isExclusiveRNA() {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    private final String name;\n\n    private Nucleotide(final String fullName) {\n        this.name = fullName;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\n"},"04_oop/encapsulation.html":{"url":"04_oop/encapsulation.html","title":"Encapsulation revisited","keywords":"","body":"Encapsulation\nIn this post, I want to revisit one of the most basic of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: encapsulation.\nIt is a principle my students often fail to see the use for. And I must admit some \nof my colleagues as well – especially those who are really into Python. They are of the opinion that NOTHING should be hidden. Just be careful when programming. \nWell, my response is: some people also argue that Evolution is just a theory that you can simply disagree with!\nSo what does encapsulation exactly mean? My good friend Wikipedia tells me that \n“It allows selective hiding of properties and methods in an object by building \nan impenetrable wall to protect the code from accidental corruption“. Key here \nis the word corruption of course. Let’s look at an example in code. Note: of \ncourse there are Javadoc comments missing, and some other issues with the code \ncan be discussed, but I have taken the liberty to keep things simple for the \npurpose of demonstrating encapsulation.\nHere is class SequenceManager, the main class of a GUI application managing \nbiological sequences:\n\npackage encapsulation;\n\n\npublic final class SequenceManager {\n\n    public static void main(final String[] args) {\n        SequenceManager mainObject = new SequenceManager();\n        mainObject.start();\n    }\n\n    private void start() {\n        SequenceCollection sc = new SequenceCollection();\n        sc.addSequence(new Sequence(\"Gene 1\", \"GAATTC\", \"gi|12345\"));\n        sc.addSequence(new Sequence(\"Gene 2\", \"GAATTC\", \"gi|98765\"));\n\n        MyCoolGUIPanel guiPanel = new MyCoolGUIPanel(sc);\n        guiPanel.showSequenceCollection();\n\n        //also add to other panels of the GUI\n    }\n}\n\nNothing funny going on here. A SequenceCollection is created and stocked (of course, in real life this will come from some file or database), and subsequently passed to some GUI panels for displaying and managing. \nThe Sequence class looks quite like any POJO you will ever meet:\n\npackage encapsulation;\n\npublic class Sequence {\n    private String name;\n    private String sequence;\n    private final String id;\n\n    public Sequence(String name, String sequence, String id) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.sequence = sequence;\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    public Sequence(String name, String id) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getSequence() {\n        return sequence;\n    }\n\n    public void setSequence(String sequence) {\n        this.sequence = sequence;\n    }\n\n    public String getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n}\n\nThe only noteworthy thing here is the omission of a setter for the Sequence ID, \nand the id member being final (often a good choice for identifiers of bean \nobjects).\nNow, the collection class managing our sequences:  \n\npackage encapsulation;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\n\npublic class SequenceCollection {\n    private HashMap sequences;\n\n    /**\n     * constructor instantuiates the collection\n     */\n    public SequenceCollection() {\n        this.sequences = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * adds a sequence to the collection\n     * @param seq \n     */\n    public void addSequence(Sequence seq) {\n        this.sequences.put(seq.getId(), seq);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * getter for the sequence hash\n     * @return sequences\n     */\n    public HashMap getSequences() {\n        return this.sequences;\n    }\n}\n\nThis class contains the origin of a world of pain. The class seems to be simple \nenough, providing a method to add a sequence and a getter offering a ways to \niterate over the collection. Can you see why this is the origin of a world of \npain? No? Let’s have a look at the GUI JPanel displaying some aspect of this \ncollection (yes I know swing is becoming a bit outdated for GUIs).\npackage encapsulation;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\n\npublic class MyCoolGUIPanel extends JPanel{\n\n    private SequenceCollection seqColl;\n\n    public MyCoolGUIPanel(SequenceCollection sc) {\n        this.seqColl = sc;\n    }\n\n    public void showSequenceCollection() {\n        /*\n        * panel logic here\n        */\n    }\n\n    private void removeButtonClicked(String seqID) {\n        //the remove sequence button was clicked so a sequence is removed\n        seqColl.getSequences().remove(seqID);\n    }\n}\n\nSo what happens when somebody decides to remove a sequence from the collection? \nThe getter on the SequenceCollection object is called to access the underlying \nCollection class, and the wretched object is removed.  \nWITHOUT ANYONE ELSE BEING AWARE OF THIS!  \nOther JPanels, the SequenceCollection object itself – nobody knows a Sequence \nobject has met its maker! Having a getter offering access to a Collection like \nwhat we have seen in the SequenceCollection class and the HashMap is like dropping \nyour bank card onto the floor of a bar with the pin code written on the back. \nYou can bet somebody is going to take the invitation to trash your account.\nSo what is the solution? Exactly, encapsulate your inner workings. There are \nseveral simple ways to do this. Here is the simplest one:\npublic Map getSequences() {\n    return Collections.unmodifiableMap(sequences);\n}\n\nThe Javadocs have this to say about the Collections.unmodifiableMap method: \n“Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified collection. This method allows \nmodules to provide users with “read-only” access to internal collections. \nQuery operations on the returned collection “read through” to the specified \ncollection, and attempts to modify the returned collection, whether direct or \nvia its iterator, result in an UnsupportedOperationException.” So this line\nseqColl.getSequences().remove(seqID);  \nwill throw such an Exception. What I like slightly better through is an iterator:  \npublic Iterator getSequenceIterator() {\n    return this.sequences.values().iterator();\n}\n\nOr, when you really want to have the joy of the Java for(each) loop:\npublic List getSequenceList() {\n    return new ArrayList(this.sequences.values());\n}\n\nAll these strategies will keep your data safe, but the last two also hide \nthe inner workings of your SequenceCollection class so these should be \npreferred.  \n"},"04_oop/inner_classes.html":{"url":"04_oop/inner_classes.html","title":"Inner classes","keywords":"","body":"Inner classes\nWhile we have done so almost always, there is a  misconception about how many classes can exist in one source file.\nThere can be only one public top-level class per source file.\nA source file can, however, have many static and non-static inner classes, non-public classes, anonymous inner classes and interface implementers.\nHere is an example showing some inner class types.\npackage snippets.oop;\n\n//top level public class\npublic class Outer {\n    //inner anonymous implementer of inner interface\n    private Usable usable = new Usable() {\n        public void use() {\n            System.out.println(\"doing it this way\");\n        }\n    };\n    //idem, same interface\n    private Usable usableTwo = new Usable() {\n        public void use() {\n            System.out.println(\"doing it that way\");\n        }\n    };\n    //non-anonymous inner class instance\n    private Usable usable3 = new UsableUsable();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Outer outer = new Outer();\n        outer.usable.use();\n        outer.usableTwo.use();\n        outer.usable3.use();\n        outer.useInners();\n    }\n\n    public void useInners() {\n        Inner i = new Inner();\n        i.doIt();\n    }\n\n    /* A non-static inner class that needs an instance of Outer to exist.\n    * Usually it is extremely tightly bound to the Outer class logic*/\n    private class Inner {\n        public void doIt() {\n            System.out.println(\"doing it inner\");\n            //access to instance fields!\n            usableTwo.use();\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n    * A static (although not explicity stated) interface\n     */\n    private interface Usable {\n        public void use();\n    }\n\n    /*static implementer*/\n    private static class UsableUsable implements Usable {\n        @Override\n        public void use() {\n            System.out.println(\"doing it the other way\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\noutputs \n\ndoing it this way\ndoing it that way\ndoing it the other way\ndoing it inner\ndoing it that way\n\n\nSome general rules on the use of inner classes:  \n\nUse an inner class when it is tightly bound to the Outer class, and there is no reason for existence outside the outer class. \nUse an anonymous inner class when there is no scenario of reusability\nonly use a non-static inner class when it should be bound to an instance of the outer class, else use a static inner class (a nested class)\n\n"},"design_rules.html":{"url":"design_rules.html","title":"Design Rules summary","keywords":"","body":"Design rules\nequals() and hashCode()\n\nAlways implement equals() and hashCode(), when objects are going to live in collections (which is quite often!)\nAlways implement both equals and hashCode; never only one!\nAnd have your IDE generate it for you...\n\nClasses\n\nWhen a class defines an instance variable that needs to be initialized in order to have an object that makes sense, and you can not give it a reasonable default value, you should make it a constructor parameter \nConsider the use of factory methods instead of constructors\nMake classes abstract that should not be instantiated\nChain constructors using this(fieldValue, fieldValue)\n\nCode against interfaces, not implementations\nUse interfaces and abstract classes as the declared type of your variables.
